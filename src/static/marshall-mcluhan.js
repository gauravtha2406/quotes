    "All media exist to invest our lives with artificial perceptions and arbitrary values.",
    "All media work us over completely. They are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered. The medium is the message. Any understanding of social and cultural change is impossible without a knowledge of the way media work as environments. All media are extensions of some human faculty - psychic or physical.",
    "We become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us.",
    "Politics will eventually be replaced by imagery. The politician will be only too happy to abdicate in favor of his image, because the image will be so much more powerful than he could ever be.",
    "People hope that if they scream loudly enough about \"values\" then others will mistake them for serious, sensitive souls who have higher and nobler perceptions than ordinary people. Otherwise, why would they be screaming? Moral bitterness is a basic technique for endowing the idiot with dignity.",
    "There are many people for whom 'thinking' necessarily means identifying with existing trends.",
    "There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew.",

    "Invention is the mother of necessities.",
    "Anyone who tries to make a distinction between education and entertainment doesn't know the first thing about either.",
    "Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the content of the communication.",
    "Once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to the private manipulation of those who would try to benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we don't really have any rights left. Leasing our eyes and ears and nerves to commercial interests is like handing over the common speech to a private corporation, or like giving the earth's atmosphere to a company as a monopoly.",
    "A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding.",
    "One of the effects of living with electric information is that we live habitually in a state of information overload. There's always more than you can cope with.",
    "The tribalizing power of the new electronic media, the way in which they return to us to the unified fields of the old oral cultures, to tribal cohesion and pre-individualist patterns of thought, is little understood. Tribalism is the sense of the deep bond of family, the closed society as the norm of community.",
    "I wouldn't have seen it if I hadn't believed it.",
    "The more the data banks record about each one of us, the less we exist.",
    "Like primitive, we now live in a global village of our own making, a simultaneous happening. It doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs.",
    "Don't ask whether it is right or wrong. Instead try to find out what is going on.",
    "I don't necessarily agree with everything I say.",
    "Everybody experiences far more than he understands. Yet it is experience, rather than understanding, that influences behavior.",
    "Computers can do better than ever what needn't be done at all. Making sense is still a human monopoly.",

    "As a rule, I always look for what others ignore.",
    "In television, images are projected at you. You are the screen. The images wrap around you. You are the vanishing point.",

    "The computer is the most extraordinary of man's technological clothing; it's an extension of our central nervous system. Beside it, the wheel is a mere hula-hoop.",
    "The new is always made up of the old, or rather, what people see in the new is always the old thing. The rear-view mirror. The future of the future is the present, and this is something that people are terrified of.",
    "Timeâ€™ has ceased, 'space' has vanished. We now live in a global village... a simultaneous happening",
    "\"Work\" does not exist in a nonliterate world. The primitive hunter or fisherman did no work, any more than does the poet, painter, or thinker of today. Where the whole man is involved there is no work.",
    "Our Age of Anxiety is, in great part, the result of trying to do today's job with yesterday's tools and yesterday's concepts.",
    "Violence is the quest for identity. When identity disappears with technological innovation, violence is the natural recourse.",
    "The ordinary person senses the greatness of the odds against him even without thought or analysis, and he adapts his attitudes unconsciously. A huge passivity has settled on industrial society. For people carried about in mechanical vehicles, earning their living by waiting on machines, listening much of the waking day to canned music, watching packaged movie entertainment and capsulated news, for such people it would require an exceptional degree of awareness and an especial heroism of effort to be anything but supine consumers of processed goods.",
    "When information overload occurs, pattern recognition is how to determine truth.",
    "Affluence creates poverty.",
    "The most human thing about us is our technology.",
    "The poet, the artist, the sleuth, whoever sharpens our perception tends to antisocial; rarely 'well adjusted,' he cannot go along with currents and trends.",
    "the only people who have proof of their sanity are those who have been discharged from mental institutions",
    "The business of art is no longer the communication of thoughts or feelings which are to be conceptually ordered, but a direct participation in an experience. The whole tendency of modern communication...is towards participation in a process, rather than apprehension of concepts.",
    "The medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium - that is, of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology.",
    "We look at the present through a rear view mirror. We march backwards into the future.",

    "Most of our assumptions have outlived their uselessness.",
    "The answers are always inside the problem, not outside.",
    "Radical changes of identity, happening suddenly and in very brief intervals of time, have proved more deadly and destructive of human values than wars fought with hardware weapons.",

    "I may be wrong, but I'm never in doubt.",
    "Any breakdown is a breakthrough.",
    "With the arrival of electric technology, man extended, or set outside himself, a live model of the central nervous system itself. To the degree that this is so, it is a development that suggests a desperate and suicidal autoamputation, as if the central nervous system could no longer depend on the physical organs to be protective buffers against the slings and arrows of outrageous mechanism.",
    "An administrator in a bureaucratic world is a man who can feel big by merging his non-entity in an abstraction. A real person in touch with real things inspires terror in him.",
    "Moral indignation is a technique used to endow the idiot with dignity.",

    "I do not explain, I explore.",
    "There ain't no grammatical errors in a non-literate society.",
    "I am resolutely opposed to all innovation, all change, but I am determined to understand whatâ€™s happening. Because I donâ€™t choose just to sit and let the juggernaut roll over me. Many people seem to think that if you talk about something recent, youâ€™re in favor of it. The exact opposite is true in my case. Anything I talk about is almost certainly something Iâ€™m resolutely against. And it seems to me the best way to oppose it is to understand it. And then you know where to turn off the buttons.",
    "Jokes are grievances.",

    "The specialist is one who never makes small mistakes while moving toward the grand fallacy.",
    "Publication is a self-invasion of privacy.",
    "The price of eternal vigilance is indifference.",
    "When people become too intense, too serious, they will have trouble in relating to any sort of social game or norm. Perhaps this is why jokes are so important. On one hand they tell us about where the problems and grievances are, and, at the same time, they provide the means of enduring these grievances by laughing at the problems.",
    "Attention spans get very weak at the speed of light, and that goes along with a very weak identity.",
    "The young today cannot follow narrative but they are alert to drama. They cannot bear description but they love landscape and action.",
    "If men were able to be convinced that art is a precise advance knowledge of how to cope with the psychic and social consequences of the next technology, would they all become artist? Or would they begin a careful translation of new art forms into social navigation charts? I am curious to know what would happem if art were suddenly seen for what it is, namely, exact information of how to rearrange one's psyche in order to anticipate the next blow from our own extended faculties.",
    "The greatest propaganda in the world is our mother tongue, that is what we learn as children, and which we learn unconsciously. That shapes our perceptions for life. That is propaganda at its most extreme form.",
    "It has always been the artist who realizes that the future is the present and uses his work to prepare the grounds for it",
    "People don't actually read newspapers - they get into them every morning like a hot bath.",
    "Advertising is the greatest art form of the 20th century.",
    "Physiologically, man in the normal use of technology (or his variously extended body) is perpetually modified by it and in turn finds ever new ways of modifying his technology. Man becomes, as it were, the sex organs of the machine world, as the bee of the plant world, enabling it to fecundate and to evolve ever new forms. The machine world reciprocates man's love by expediting his wishes and desires, namely, in providing him with wealth.",
    "The percept takes priority of the concept.",
    "Poetry and the arts canâ€™t exist in America. Mere exposure to the arts does nothing for a mentality which is incorrigibly dialectical. The vital tensions and nutritive action of ideogram\n remain inaccessible to this state of mind.",
    "First we build the tools, then they build us.",
    "The electric age ... established a global network that has much the character of our central nervous system.",
    "Those conspiracies that are too incredible to be believed, are by the same right, those which most often succeed.",
    "Anything that's popular is a rear-view image.",
    "Professionalism merges the individual into patterns of total environment. Amateurism seeks the development of the total awareness of the individual and the critical awareness of the groundrules of society. The amateur can afford to lose. The professional tends to classify and specialise, to accept uncritically the groundrules of the environment. The groundrules provided by the mass response of his colleagues serve as a pervasive environment of which he is contentedly unaware. The 'expert' is the man who stays put.",
    "Mass man is a phenomenon of electric speed, not of physical quantity.",
    "Our permanent address is tommorrow.",
    "During the Second War, the U.S.O. sent special issues of the principal American magazines to the Armed Forces, with the ads omitted. The men insisted on having the ads back again. Naturally. The ads are by far the best part of any magazine or newspaper. More pains and thought, more wit and art go into the making of an ad than into any prose feature of press or magazine. Ads are news. What is wrong with them is that they are always good news.",
    "It is one of the peculiar characteristics of the photograph that it isolates single moments in time.",
    "If we understand the revolutionary transformations caused by new media, we can anticipate and control them; but if we continue in our self-induced subliminal trance, we will be their slaves.",
    "Language is a form of organized stutter.",

    "Electronic man has no physical body.",
    "Today's child is bewildered when he enters the 19th century environment that still characterizes the educational establishment where information is scarce but ordered and structured by fragmented, classified patterns subjects, and schedules.",
    "Ads represent the main channel of intellectual and artistic effort in the modern world.",
    "All forms of violence are quests for identity. When you live on the frontier, you have no identity. You're a nobody.",
    "The artist is the person who invents the means to bridge between biological inheritance and the environments created by technological innovation.",
    "I expect to see the coming decades transform the planet into an art form; the new man, linked in a cosmic harmony that transcends time and space, will sensuously caress and mold and pattern every facet of the terrestrial artifact as if it were a work of art, and man himself will become an organic art form.",
    "Some of my fellow academics are very hostile, but I sympathize with them. They've been asleep for 500 years and they don't like anybody who comes along and stirs them up.",
    "Mass transportation is doomed to failure in North America because a person's car is the only place where he can be alone and think.",
    "The village had institutionalized all human functions in forms of low intensity.... Participation was high and organization was low. This is the formula for stability.",
    "Mysticism is just tomorrow's science dreamed today.",
    "I am a Christian according to my conscience in belief,in purpose and wish;Mnot of course by the orthodox standard. But I am content, and have a feeling of trust and safety.\nThe Machiavellian mind and the merchant mind are at one in their simple faith in the power of segmental division to rule all--in the dichotomy of power and morals and of money and morals.",
    "The car has become the carapace, the protective and aggressive shell, of urban and suburban man.",
    "To say that \"the camera cannot lie\" is merely to underline the multiple deceits that are now practised in its name.",
    "As the unity of the modern world becomes increasingly a technological rather than a social affair, the techniques of the arts provide the most valuable means of insight into the real direction of our own collective purposes.",
    "Ideally, advertising aims at the goal of a programmed harmony among all human impulses and aspirations and endeavors. Using handicraft methods, it stretches out toward the ultimate electronic goal of a collective consciousness.",
    "People who write obscurely are either unskilled in writing or up to mischief.",
    "Far more thought and care go into the composition of any prominent ad in a newspaper or magazine than go into the writing of their features and editorials.",
    "The bible belt is oral territory and therefore despised by the literati.",
    "Artists in various fields are always the first to discover how to enable one medium or to release the power of another.",

    "Our technology forces us to live mythically",
    "Education, which should be helping youth to understand and adapt to their revolutionary new environments, is instead being used merely as an instrument of cultural aggression.",
    "Pornography and violence are by-products of societies in which private identity has been ... destroyed by sudden environmental change.",
    "The literate man is a sucker for propaganda...You cannot propagandize a native. You can sell him rum and trinkets, but you cannot sell him ideas.",
    "Only the vanquished remember history.",
    "Control over change would seem to consist in moving not with it but ahead of it. Anticipation gives the power to deflect and control force.",
    "A moral point of view too often serves as a substitute for understanding in technological matters.",
    "As technology advances, it reverses the characteristics of every situation again and again. The age of automation is going to be the age of 'do it yourself.'",
    "First we shape our tools, thereafter they shape us",
    "Any ad consciously attended to is comical. Ads are not meant for conscious consumption. They are intended as subliminal pills for the subconsious in order to exercise an hypnotic spell, especially on sociologists.",
    "Our motor car is our supreme form of privacy when we are away from home.",
    "Youth instinctively understand the present environment - the electric drama. It lives mythically and in depth.",

    "The scientist rigorously defends his right to be ignorant of almost everything except his specialty.",
    "Darkness is to space what silence is to sound, i.e., the interval.",
    "Whence did the wond'rous mystic art arise, / Of painting SPEECH, and speaking to the eyes? / That we by tracing magic lines are taught, / How to embody, and to colour THOUGHT?",
    "Today's child is growing up absurd, because he lives in two worlds, and neither of them inclines him to grow up. Growing up--thatis our new work, and it is total. Mere instruction will not suffice.",
    "Television brought the brutality of war into the comfort of the living room. Vietnam was lost in the living rooms of America - not on the battlefields of Vietnam.",
    "Transmitted at the speed of light, all events on this planet are simultaneous. In the electric environment of information all events are simultaneous, there is no time or space separating events.",
    "Education in a technological world of replaceable and expendable parts is neuter.",
    "In this electronic age we see ourselves being translated more and more into the form of information, moving toward the technological extension of consciousness.",
    "The alphabet and print technology fostered and encouraged a fragmenting process, a process of specialism and detachment. Electric technology fosters and encourages unification and involvement.",

    "The mark of our time is its revulsion against imposed patterns.",
    "The products of modern science are not in themselves good or bad; it is the way they are used that determines their value.",
    "When things come at you very fast, naturally you lose touch with yourself.",
    "The subliminal depths of radio are charged with the resonating echoes of tribal horns and antique drums. This is inherent in the very nature of this medium, with its power to turn the\npsyche and society into a single echo chamber.",
    "Phenomenology is dialectic in ear-mode - a massive and decentralized quest for roots, for ground.",
    "In large measure, writing is the spatialization of thought.",
    "The family circle has widened. The worldpool of information fathered by the electric media--movies, Telstar, flight--far surpassesany possible influence mom and dad can now bring to bear. Character no longer is shaped by only two earnest, fumbling experts. Now all the world's a sage.",
    "Canadians are the people who learned to live without the bold accents of the natural ego-trippers of other lands.",
    "The world of visual perspective is one of unified and homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of spoken words. So language was the last art to accept the visual logic of Gutenberg technology, and the first to rebound in the electric age.",
    "Language as the technology of human extension, whose powers of division and separation we know so well, may have been the \"Tower of Babel\" by which men sought to scale the highest heavens. Today computers hold out the promise of a means of instant tr",
    "Art at its most significant is a Distant Early Warning System that can always be relied on to tell the old culture what is beginning to happen to it.",
    "The content or message of any particular medium has about as much importance as the stenciling on the casing of an atomic bomb.",
    "The wheel is an extension of the foot, the book is an extension of the eye, clothing an extension of the skin, electric circuitry an extension of the central nervous system.",

    "Human perception is literally incarnation.",
    "The photograph reverses the purpose of travel, which until now had been to encounter the strange and unfamiliar.",
    "TV acting is so extremely intimate, because of the peculiar involvement of the viewer with the completion or \"closing\" of the TV image, that the actor must achieve a great degree of spontaneous casualness that would be irrelevant in movie and lost on the stage. For the audience participates in the inner life of the TV actor as fully as in the outer life of the movie star. Technically, TV tends to be a close-up medium. The close-up that in the movie is used for shock is, on TV, a quite casual thing.",
    "Logos is the formal cause of the kosmos and all things, responsible for their nature and configuration.",
    "We impose the form of the old on the content of the new.",
    "The artist is the man in any field, scientific or humanistic, who grasps the implications of his actions and of new knowledge in his own time. He is the man of integral awareness.",

    "Madison Avenue is a very powerful aggression against private consciousness. A demand that you yield your private consciousness to public manipulation.",

    "Innovation for holders of conventional wisdom is not novelty but annihilation.",
    "Even mud gives the illusion of depth.",
    "Gramophone and movies were merely the mechanization of speech and gesture. But the radio and TV were not just the electronification of speech and gesture but the electronification of the entire range of human personal expressiveness. With electronification the flow is taken out of the wire and into the vacuum tube circuit, which confers freedom and flexibility such as are in metaphor and in words themselves.",
    "Every innovation scraps its immediate predecessor and retrieves still older figures â€“ it causes floods of antiques or nostalgic art forms and stimulates the search for museum pieces.",
    "The movie stars and matinee idols are put into the public domain by photography. They become dreams that money can buy. They can be bought and thumbed more easily than public prostitutes.",

    "A typewriter is a means of transcribing thought, not expressing it.",
    "The winner is one who knows when to drop out in order to get in touch.",
    "As the age of information demands the simultaneous use of all our faculties, we discover that we are most at leisure when we are most intensely involved.",
    "Except for light, all other media come in pairs, with one acting as the \"content\" of the other, obscuring the operation of both.",
    "My main theme is the extension of the nervous system in the electric age, and thus, the complete break with five thousand years of mechanical technology. This I state over and over again. I do not say whether it is a good or bad thing. To do so would be meaningless and arrogant.",
    "To see a man slip on a banana skin is to see a rationally structured system suddenly translated into a whirling machine.",
    "The past went that-a-way. When faced with a totally new situation, we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to the flavor of the most recent past. We look at the present through a rear view mirror. We march backwards into the future.",

    "A successful book cannot afford to be more than ten percent new.",
    "The student of media soon comes to expect the New Media of any period whatever to be classed as 'pseudo' by those who acquired the patterns of earlier media, whatever they may happen to be.",
    "Our electrically-configured world has forced us to move from the habit of data classification to the mode of pattern recognition. We can no longer build serially, block-by-block, step-by-step, because instant communication insures that all factors of the environment and of experience co-exist in a state of active interplay.",

    "It is perhaps typical of very creative minds that they hit very large nails not quite on the head.",
    "Such is the content of the mental life of the Hemingway hero and the good guy in general. Every day he gets beaten into a servile pulp by his own mechanical reflexes, which are constantly busy registering and reacting to the violent stimuli which his big, noisy, kinesthetic environment has provided for his unreflective reception.",

    "Most clear writing is a sign that there is no exploration going on. Clear prose indicates the absence of thought.",
    "Persons grouped around a fire or candle for warmth or light are less able to pursue independent thoughts, or even tasks, than people supplied with electric light. In the same way, the social and educational patterns latent in automation are those of self-employment and artistic autonomy.",
    "Scribal culture and Gothic architecture were both concerned with light through, not light on.",
    "There is a real, living unity in our time, as in any other, but it lies submerged under a superficial hubbub of sensation.",

    "The new electronic independence re-creates the world in the image of a global village.",
    "[Cameras] tend to turn people into things and the photograph extends and multiplies the human image to the proportions of mass-produced merchandise and, [in the age of photography] the world itself becomes a sort of museum of objects that have been encountered before in some other museum and to say that the camera cannot lie is merely to underline the multiple deceits that are now practiced in its name.",

    "The suddenness of the leap from hardware to software cannot but produce a period of anarchy and collapse, especially in the developed countries.",
    "In experimental art, men are given the exact specifications of coming violence to their own psyches from their own counter-irritant or technology... But the counter-irritant usually proves a greater plague than the initial irritant, like a drug habit.",
    "The artist must ever play and experiment with new means of arranging experience, even though the majority of his audience may prefer to remain fixed in their old perceptual attitudes.",

    "The copy of an ad is merely a punning gag to distract the critical faculties while the image of the product goes to work on the hypnotized viewer. Those who have spent their lives protesting about 'false and misleading ad copy' are godsends to advertisers, as teetotalers are to brewers, and moral censors are to books and films. The protesters are the best acclaimers and accelerators. Since the advent of pictures, the job of the ad copy is as incidental and latent as the 'meaning' of a poem is to a poem, or the words of a song are to a song.",

    "New media may at first appear as mere codes of transmission for older achievement and established patterns of thought. But nobody could make the mistake of supposing that phonetic writing merely made it possible for the Greeks to set down in visual order what they had though and known before writing. In the same way printing made literature possible. It did not merely encode literature.",

    "As information becomes our environment, it becomes mandatory to program the environment itself as a work of art.",
    "You see, Dad, Professor McLuhan says that the environment that man creates becomes his medium for defining his role in it. The invention of type created linear, or sequential thought, separating thought from action. Now, with TV and folk singing, thought and action are closer and social involvement is greater.

A girl wearing open-mesh silk stockings or glasses is inherently cool and sensual because the eye acts as a surrogate hand in filling in the low-definition image thus engendered. Which is why boys make passes at girls who wear glasses.",
