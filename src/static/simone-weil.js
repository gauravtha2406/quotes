    "Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity.",
    "We must not wish for the disappearance of our troubles but for the grace to transform them.",
    "Pain and suffering are a kind of currency passed from hand to hand until they reach someone who receives them but does not pass them on.",
    "Just as the power of the sun is the only force in the natural universe that causes a plant to grow against gravity, so the grace of God is the only force in the spiritual universe that causes a person to grow against the gravity of their own ego.",
    "There are only two things that pierce the human heart. One is beauty. The other is affliction.",
    "Joy is being fully aware of reality.",
    "Human beings are so made that the ones who do the crushing feel nothing; it is the person crushed who feels what is happening. Unless one has placed oneself on the side of the oppressed, to feel with them, one cannot understand.",
    "The love of our neighbor in all its fullness simply means being able to say, \"What are you going through?",
    "Love: To feel with one's whole self the existence of another being.",
    "God's love for us is not the reason for which we should love him. God's love for us is the reason for us to love ourselves.",
    "Compassion directed toward oneself is true humility.",
    "The intelligent man who is proud of his intelligence is like the condemned man who is proud of his large cell.",
    "Love is not consolation, it is light.",

    "Fortunately the sky is beautiful everywhere.",
    "A mind enclosed in language is in prison.",
    "Everything beautiful has a mark of eternity.",
    "To be rooted is perhaps the most important and least recognized need of the human soul.",
    "A hurtful act is the transference to others of the degradation which we bear in ourselves.",
    "Whether the mask is labeled fascism, democracy, or dictatorship of the proletariat, our great adversary remains the apparatus—the bureaucracy, the police, the military. Not the one facing us across the frontier of the battle lines, which is not so much our enemy as our brothers' enemy, but the one that calls itself our protector and makes us its slaves. No matter what the circumstances, the worst betrayal will always be to subordinate ourselves to this apparatus and to trample underfoot, in its service, all human values in ourselves and in others.",
    "It is not religion but revolution which is the opium of the people.",
    "It is a fault to wish to be understood before we have made ourselves clear to ourselves.",
    "Evil when we are in its power is not felt as evil but as a necessity, or even a duty.",
    "If you want to know what a man is really like, take notice of how he acts when he loses money.",
    "Justice consists in seeing that no harm is done to men. Whenever a man cries inwardly: 'Why am I being hurt?' harm is being done to him. He is often mistaken when he tries to define the harm, and why and by whom it is being inflicted on him. But the cry itself is infallible.",
    "The sea is not less beautiful in our eyes because we know that sometimes ships are wrecked by it.",
    "Imagination and fiction make up more than three quarters of our real life.",
    "Every sin is an attempt to fly from emptiness.",
    "For when two beings who are not friends are near each other there is no meeting, and when friends are far apart there is no separation.",
    "Every being cries out in silence to be read differently. Do not be indifferent to these cries.",
    "When we hit a nail with a hammer, the whole of the shock received by the large head of the nail passes into the point without any of it being lost, although it is only a point. If the hammer and the head of the nail were infinitely big it would be just the same. The point of the nail would transmit this infinite shock at the point to which it was applied. Extreme affliction, which means physical pain, distress of soul and social degradation, all at the same time, constitutes the nail. The point is applied at the very center of the soul, whose head is all necessity, spreading throughout space and time.",
    "Official history is a matter of believing murderers on their own word.",
    "The great error of nearly all studies of war, an error into which all socialists have fallen, has been to consider war as an episode in foreign politics when it is especially an act of internal politics and the most atrocious act of all . . . Since the directing apparatus has no other way of fighting the enemy than by sending its own soldiers, under compulsion, to their death-the war of one state against another state resolves itself into a war of the state and the military apparatus against its own people.",
    "It is only from the light which streams constantly from heaven that a tree can derive the energy to strike its roots deep into the soil. The tree is in fact rooted in the sky.",
    "There is something else which has the power to awaken us to the truth. It is the works of writers of genius. They give us, in the guise of fiction, something equivalent to the actual density of the real, that density which life offers us every day but which we are unable to grasp because we are amusing ourselves with lies.",
    "Art is the symbol of the two noblest human efforts: to construct and to refrain from destruction.",
    "Religion as a source of consolation is an obstacle to true faith.",
    "It is grace that forms the void inside us and it is grace that can fill the void.",
    "At the centre of the human heart is the longing for an absolute good, a longing which is always there and is never appeased by any object in this world.",
    "Absolutely unmixed attention is prayer.",
    "Those who are unhappy have no need for anything in this world but people capable of giving them their attention.",
    "Never react to an evil in such a way as to augment it.",
    "There is no greater joy for me than looking at the sky on a clear night with an attention so concentrated that all my other thoughts disappear; then one can think that the stars enter into one's soul.",
    "Equality is the public recognition, effectively expressed in institutions and manners, of the principle that an equal degree of attention is due to the needs of all human beings.",
    "Truth is sought not because it is truth but because it is good.",
    "The extreme greatness of Christianity lies in the fact that it does not seek a supernatural remedy for suffering but a supernatural use for it.",
    "The needs of a human being are sacred. Their satisfaction cannot be subordinated either to reasons of state, or to any consideration of money, nationality, race, or color, or to the moral or other value attributed to the human being in question, or to any consideration whatsoever.",
    "The vulnerability of precious things is beautiful because vulnerability is a mark of existence. The destruction of Troy. The fall of the petals from fruit trees in blossom. To know that what is most precious is not rooted in existence - that is beautiful.",
    "The virtue of hope is an orientation of the soul towards a transformation after which it will be wholly and exclusively love.",
    "There is one, and only one, thing in modern society more hideous than crime namely, repressive justice.",
    "Human existence is so fragile a thing and exposed to such dangers that I cannot love without trembling.",
    "A beautiful woman looking at her image in the mirror may very well believe the image is herself. An ugly woman knows it is not.",

    "If we go down into ourselves, we find that we possess exactly what we desire.",
    "To be always relevant, you have to say things which are eternal.",
    "Patriotism is idolatry of the self.",
    "Everything which originates from pure love is lit with the radiance of beauty.",
    "Love of God is pure when joy and suffering inspire an equal degree of gratitude.",
    "When war is waged, it is for the purpose of safeguarding or increasing one's capacity to make war. International politics are wholly involved in this vicious cycle. What is called national prestige consists in behaving always in such a way as to demoralize other nations by giving them the impression that, if it comes to war, one would certainly defeat them. What is called national security is an imaginary state of affairs in which one would retain the capacity to make war while depriving all other countries of it.",
    "God is rich in mercy. I know this wealth of his with the certainty of experience, I have touched it.",
    "One has only the choice between God and idolatry. There is no other possibility. For the faculty of worship is in us, and it is either directed somewhere into this world, or into another.",
    "Difficult as it is really to listen to someone in affliction, it is just as difficult for him to know that compassion is listening to him.",
    "In struggling against anguish one never produces serenity; the struggle against anguish only produces new forms of anguish.",
    "The afflicted are not listened to. They are like someone whose tongue has been cut out and who occasionally forgets the fact. When they move their lips no ear perceives any sound. And they themselves soon sink into impotence in the use of language, because of the certainty of not being heard.",
    "To die for God is not a proof of faith in God. To die for an unknown and repulsive convict who is a victim of injustice, that is a proof of faith in God.",
    "It is much easier to imagine ourselves in the place of God the Creator than in the place of Christ crucified.",
    "An atheist may be simply one whose faith and love are concentrated on the impersonal aspects of God.",
    "I also am other than what I imagine myself to be. To know this is forgiveness.",
    "Prayer consists simply in giving to God all the careful attention of which the soul is capable.",
    "Everybody knows that really intimate conversation is only possible between two or three. As soon as there are six or seven, collective language begins to dominate. That is why it is a complete misinterpretation to apply to the Church the words 'Wheresoever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.' Christ did not say two hundred, or fifty, or ten. He said two or three.",
    "What a country calls its vital economic interests are not the things which enable its citizens to live, but the things which enable it to make war. Petrol is more likely than wheat to be a cause of international conflict.",
    "Beauty captivates the flesh in order to obtain permission to pass right through to the soul. . . . When the feeling for beauty happens to be associated with the sight of some human being, the transference of love is made possible, at any rate in an illusory manner. But it is all the beauty of the world, it is universal beauty, for which we yearn.",
    "When a man's life is destroyed or damaged by some wound or privation of soul or body, which is due to other men's actions or negligence, it is not only his sensibility that suffers but also his aspiration toward the good. Therefore there has been sacrilege towards that which is sacred in him.",
    "Imaginary evil is romantic and varied; real evil is gloomy, monotonous, barren, boring. Imaginary good is boring; real good is always new, marvelous, intoxicating.",
    "A man thinks he is dying for his country,\" said Anatole France, \"but he is dying for a few industrialists.\" But even that is saying too much. What one dies for is not even so substantial and tangible as an industrialist.",
    "The beauty of the world is Christ's tender smile for us coming through matter.",
    "All sins are attempts to fill voids.",
    "True definition of science: the study of the beauty of the world.",
    "Sin is not a distance, it is a turning of our gaze in the wrong direction.",
    "The glossy surface of our civilization hides a real intellectual decadence.",
    "It is only necessary to know that love is a direction and not a state of the soul. If one is unaware of this, one falls to despair at the first onslaught of affliction.",
    "Even if our efforts of attention seem for years to be producing no result, one day a light that is in exact proportion to them will flood the soul.",
    "If you say to someone who has ears to hear: \"What you are doing to me is not just,\" you may touch and awaken at its source the spirit of attention and love. But it is not the same with words like, \"I have the right...\" or \"you have no right to...\" They evoke a latent war and awaken the spirit of contention.",
    "It is not through the way in which someone speaks about God that I can see  whether that person has passed through the crucible of Divine Love, but through the way the person speaks to me about things here on earth.",
    "Everything without exception which is of value in me comes from somewhere other than myself, not as a gift but as a loan which must be ceaselessly renewed.",
    "Modern life is given over to immoderation. Immoderation invades everything: actions and thought, public and private life.",
    "We do injury to a child if we bring it up in a narrow Christianity, which prevents it from ever becoming capable of perceiving that there are treasures of purest gold to be found in non-Christian civilizations. Laical education does an even greater injury to children. It covers up those treasures, and those of Christianity as well.",
    "I suffer more from the humiliations inflicted by my country than from those inflicted on her.",
    "Stars and blossoming fruit-trees: utter permanence and extreme fragility give an equal sense of eternity.",
    "Justice. To be ever ready to admit that another person is something quite different from what we read when he is there (or when we think about him). Or rather, to read in him that he is certainly something different, perhaps something completely different from what we read in him. Every being cries out silently to be read differently.",
    "Do not allow yourself to be imprisoned by any affection. Keep your solitude. The day, if it ever comes, when you are given true affection, there will be no opposition between interior solitude and friendship, quite the reverse. It is even by this infallible sigh that you will recognize it.",
    "Power ... is the supreme end for all those who have not understood.",
    "Just as a person who is always asserting that he is too good-natured is the very one from whom to expect, on some occasion, the coldest and most unconcerned cruelty, so when any group sees itself as the bearer of civilization this very belief will betray it into behaving barbarously at the first opportunity.",
    "The difference between more or less intelligent men is like the difference between criminals condemned to life imprisonment in smaller or larger cells. The intelligent man who is proud of his intelligence is like a condemned man who is proud of his large cell.",
    "I can, therefore I am.",
    "Fire destroys that which feeds it.",
    "Grace fills empty spaces, but it can only enter where there is a void to receive it, and it is grace itself which makes this void.",
    "Two prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by knocking on the wall. The wall is the thing which separates them but is also their means of communication. It is the same with us and God. Every separation is a link.",
    "When once a certain class of people has been placed by the temporal and spiritual authorities outside the ranks of those whose life has value, then nothing comes more naturally to men than murder.",
    "Humility is attentive patience.",
    "The great error of nearly all studies of war... has been to consider war as an episode in foreign policies, when it is an act of interior politics.",
    "The work of art which I do not make, none other will ever make.",
    "It is an eternal obligation toward the human being not to let him suffer from hunger when one has a chance of coming to his assistance.",
    "Workers need poetry more than bread. They need that their life should be a poem. They need some light from eternity. Religion alone can be the source of such poetry.",
    "What is surprising is not that oppression should make its appearance only after higher forms of economy have been reached, but that it should always accompany them.",
    "The struggle between the opponents and defenders of capitalism is a struggle between innovators who do not know what innovation to make and conservatives who do not know what to conserve.",
    "We are like plants which have the one choice of being in or out of the light.",
    "The Hebrews took for their idol, not something made of metal or wood, but a race, a nation, something just as earthly. Their religion is essentially inseparable from such idolatry, because of the notion of the 'chosen people'.",
    "To claim that theft or adultery or lying are \"evil\" simply reflects our degraded idea of good-—that it has something to do with respect for property, respectability, and sincerity.",
    "All the tragedies which we can imagine return in the end to the one and only tragedy: the passage of time.",
    "To wish to escape from solitude is cowardice. Friendship is not to be sought, not to be dreamed, not to be desired; it is to be exercised (it is a virtue).",
    "We have to endure the discordance between imagination and fact. It is better to say, “I am suffering,” than to say, “This landscape is ugly.",
    "You could not be born at a better period than the present, when we have lost everything.",
    "Religion in so far as it is a source of consolation is a hindrance to true faith ; and in this sense atheism is a purification. I have to be an atheist with that part of myself which is not made for God. Among those in whom the supernatural part of themselves has not been awakened, the atheists are right and the believers wrong.",
    "If we forgive God for his crime against us, which is to have made us finite creatures, He will forgive our crime against him, which is that we are finite creatures.",
    "Humanism was not wrong in thinking that truth, beauty, liberty, and equality are of infinite value, but in thinking that man can get them for himself without grace.",
    "The danger is not lest the soul should doubt whether there is any bread, but lest, by a lie, it should persuade itself that it is not hungry.",
    "Oppression that is clearly inexorable and invincible does not give rise to revolt but to submission.",
    "In reality nothing is so beautiful as the good, nothing is so monotonous and boring as evil.",
    "Every time that a man has, with a pure heart, called upon Osiris, Dionysus, Buddha, the Tao, etc., the Son of God has answered him by sending the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit has acted upon his soul, not by inciting him to abandon his religious tradition, but by bestowing upon him light. It is, therefore, useless to send out missions to prevail upon the peoples of Asia, Africa or Oceania to enter the Church.",
    "Force is as pitiless to the man who possesses it, or thinks he does, as it is to its victims; the second it crushes, the first it intoxicates. The truth is, nobody really possesses it.",
    "Time's violence rends the soul, by the rent eternity enters.",
    "It is not my business to think about myself. My business is to think about God. It is for God to think about me.",
    "The highest ecstasy is the attention at its fullest.",
    "Purity is the ability to contemplate defilement.",
    "Uprooting is by far the most dangerous of the ills of human society, for it perpetuates itself.",
    "We have to try to cure our faults by attention and not by will.",
    "Real genius is nothing else but the supernatural virtue of humility in the domain of thought.",
    "The capacity to give one's attention to a sufferer is a very rare and difficult thing; it is almost a miracle; it is a miracle. Nearly all those who think they have the capacity do not possess it.",
    "The future is made of the same stuff as the present.",
    "The recognition of human wretchedness is difficult for whoever is rich and powerful because he is almost invincibly led to believe that he is something. It is equally difficult for the man in miserable circumstances because he is almost invincibly led to believe that the rich and powerful man is something.",
    "A work of art has an author and yet, when it is perfect, it has something which is anonymous about it.",
    "If someone does me injury I must desire that this injury shall not degrade me. I must desire this out of love for him who inflicts it, in order that he may not really have done evil.",
    "Bourgeois society is infected by monomania: the monomania of accounting. For it, the only thing that has value is what can be counted in francs and centimes. It never hesitates to sacrifice human life to figures which look well on paper, such as national budgets or industrial balance sheets.",
    "There is only one fault, only one: our inability to feed upon light.",
    "At the bottom of the heart of every human being, from earliest infancy until the tomb, there is something that goes on indomitably expecting, in the teeth of all experience of crimes committed, suffered, and witnessed, that good and not evil will be done",
    "It is not for man to seek, or even to believe in, God.\n He only has to refuse his ultimate love to everything that is not God.\n This refusal does not presuppose any belief.\n It is enough to recognize what is obvious to any mind:\n that all the goods of this world, past, present, and future, real or imaginary,\n are finite and limited and radically incapable of satisfying\n the desire that perpetually burns within us\n for an infinite and perfect good.",
    "Money destroys human roots wherever it is able to penetrate, by turning desire for gain into the sole motive. It easily manages to outweigh all other motives, because the effort it demands of the mind is so very much less. Nothing is so clear and so simple as a row of figures.",
    "It seemed to me certain, and I still think so today, that one can never wrestle enough with God if one does so out of pure regard for the truth. Christ likes us to prefer truth to him because, before being Christ, he is truth. If one turns aside from him to go toward the truth, one will not go far before falling into his arms.",
    "The need of truth is more sacred than any other need.",
    "A test of what is real is that it is hard and rough. Joys are found in it, not pleasure. What is pleasant belongs to dreams.",
    "Expectant waiting is the foundation of the spiritual life.",
    "If Germany, thanks to Hitler and his successors, were to enslave the European nations and destroy most of the treasures of their past, future historians would certainly pronounce that she had civilized Europe.",
    "What a country calls its vital... interests are not things that help its people live, but things that help it make war.",
    "The only way into truth is through one's own annihilation; through dwelling a long time in a state of extreme and total humiliation.",
    "We cannot take a step toward the heavens. God crosses the universe and comes to us.",
    "The world needs saints who have genius, just as a plague-stricken town needs doctors.",
    "The appetite for power, even for universal power, is only insane when there is no possibility of indulging it; a man who sees the possibility opening before him and does not try to grasp it, even at the risk of destroying himself and his country, is either",
    "Of two men who have no experience of God, he who denies him is perhaps nearer to him than the other.",
    "We do not obtain the most precious gifts by going in search of them but by waiting for them.",
    "One should identify oneself with the universe itself. Everything that is less than the universe is subjected to suffering.",
    "There is an easiness in salvation which is more difficult to us than all our efforts.",
    "A modern factory reaches perhaps almost the limit of horror. Everybody in it is constantly harassed and kept on edge by the interference of extraneous wills while the soul is left in cold desolate misery. What man needs is silence and warmth; what he is given is an icy pandemonium. Physical labor may be painful, but it is not degrading as such. It is not art; it is not science; it is something else, possessing an exactly equal value with art and science, for it provides an equal opportunity to reach the impersonal stage of attention.",
    "Every atheist is an idolater- unless he is worshipping the true God in his impersonal aspect. The majority of the pious are idolaters.",
    "With no matter what human being, taken individually, I always find reasons for concluding that sorrow and misfortune do not suit him; either because he seems too mediocre for anything so great, or, on the contrary, too precious to be destroyed.",
    "One cannot imagine St. Francis of Assisi talking about rights.",
    "Nothing is worse than extreme affliction which destroys the \"I\" from the outside, because after that we can no longer destroy it ourselves.",
    "I think that it is useless to fight directly against natural weaknesses. One has to force oneself to act as though one did not have them in circumstances where a duty makes it imperative; and in the ordinary course of life one has to know these weaknesses, prudently take them into account, and strive to turn them to good purpose; for they are all capable of being put to some good purpose.",
    "Misfortunes leave wounds which bleed drop by drop even in sleep; thus little by little they train man by force and dispose him to wisdom in spite of himself. Man must learn to think ofhimself as a limited and dependent being; and only suffering teaches him this.",
    "Gregorian chant, Romanesque architecture, the Iliad , the invention of geometry were not, for the people through whom they were brought into being and made available to us, occasions for the manifestation of personality.",
    "The destruction of the past is perhaps the greatest of all crimes.",
    "The entire universe is nothing but a great metaphor.",
    "Today it is not nearly enough to be a saint, but we must have the saintliness demanded by the present moment, a new saintliness, itself also without precedent.",
    "To want friendship is a great fault. Friendship ought to be a gratuitous joy, like the joys afforded by art or life.",
    "The proper method of philosophy consists in clearly conceiving the insoluble problems in all their insolubility and then in simply contemplating them, fixedly and tirelessly, year after year, without any hope, patiently waiting.",
    "The beautiful is the experimental proof that the incarnation is possible.",
    "Evil being the root of mystery, pain is the root of knowledge.",
    "Beauty always promises, but never gives anything.",
    "Because no other could do it, he himself went to the greatest possible distance, the infinite distance. This infinite distance between God and God, this supreme tearing apart, this incomparable agony, this marvel of love, is the crucifixion. Nothing can be further from God than that which has been made accursed.",
    "If we concentrate our attention on trying to solve a problem of geometry, and if at the end of an hour we are no nearer to doing so than at the beginning, we have nevertheless been making progress each minute of that hour in another more mysterious dimension. Without knowing or feeling it, this apparent barren affort has brought more light into the soul.",
    "All those who possess in its pure state the love of their neighbour and the acceptance of the order of the world, inclucing affliction-all those, even should they live and die to all appearances atheists, are surely saved.",
    "I am not a Catholic; but I consider the Christian idea, which has its roots in Greek thought and in the course of the centuries has nourished all of our European civilization, as something that one cannot renounce without becoming degraded.",
    "Sin is nothing else but the failure to recognize human wretchedness.",
    "Attachment is the great fabricator of illusions; reality can be attained only by someone who is detached.",
    "He who has not God in himself cannot feel His absence.",
    "A science which does not bring us nearer to God is worthless.",
    "Education-whether its object be children or adults, individuals or an entire people-consists in creating motives.",
    "Charity. To love human beings in so far as they are nothing. That is to love them as God does.",
    "As for the spirit of poverty, I do not remember any moment when it was not in me, although only to that unhappily small extent compatible with my imperfection. I fell in love with Saint Francis of Assisi as soon as I came to know about him. I always believed and hoped that one day Fate would force upon me the condition of a vagabond and a beggar which he embraced freely. Actually I felt the same way about prison.",
    "To us, men of the West, a very strange thing happened at the turn of the century; without noticing it, we lost science, or at least the thing that had been called by that name for the last four centuries. What we now have in place of it is something different, radically different, and we don't know what it is. Nobody knows what it is.",
    "We cannot take a single step toward heaven. It is not in our power to travel in a vertical direction. If however we look heavenward for a long time, God comes and takes us up.",
    "There are only two sorts of greatness: true greatness, which is of a spiritual order, and the old, old lie of world conquest. Conquest is an ersatz greatness.",
    "When science, art, literature, and philosophy are simply the manifestation of personality, they are on a level where glorious and dazzling achievements are possible, which can make a man's name live for thousands of years. But above this level, far above, separated by an abyss, is the level where the highest things are achieved. These things are essentially anonymous.",
    "Contradiction is the lever of transcendence.",
    "In this world, only those people who have fallen to the lowest degree of humiliation, far below beggary, who are not just without any social consideration but are regarded by all as being deprived of that foremost human dignity, reason itself - only those people, in fact, are capable of telling the truth. All the others lie.",
    "Moreover, nothing is so rare as to see misfortune fairly portrayed; the tendency is either to treat the unfortunate person as though catastrophe were his natural vocation, or to ignore the effects of misfortune on the soul, to assume, that is, that the soul can suffer and remain unmarked by it, can fail, in fact, to be recast in misfortune's image.",
    "We only possess what we renounce; what we do not renounce escapes from us.",
    "The feeding of those that are hungry is a form of contemplation.",
    "The demonstrable correlation of opposites is an image of the transcendental correlation of contradictories.",
    "One of the most exquisite pleasures of human love - to serve the loved one without his knowing it - is only possible, as regards the love of God, through atheism.",
    "It is only the impossible that is possible for God. He has given over the possible to the mechanics of matter and the autonomy of his creatures.",
    "Only he who has measured the dominion of force, and knows how not to respect it, is capable of love andjustice.",
    "It is precisely those artists and writers who are most inclined to think of their art as the manifestation of their personality who are in fact the most in bondage to public taste.",
    "What hope is there for innocence if it is not recognized?",
    "How many people have been thus led, through lack of self-confidence, to stifle their most justified doubts?",
    "It is human misery and not pleasure which contains the secret of the divine wisdom.",
    "Affliction hardens and discourages us because, like a red hot iron, it stamps the soul to its very depths with the scorn, the disgust, and even the self-hatred and sense of guilt that crime logically should produce but actually does not.",
    "Death. An instantaneous state, without past or future. Indispensable for entering eternity.",
    "Every kind of reward constitutes a degradation of energy.",
    "The miser deprives himself of his treasure because of his desire for it.",
    "When literature becomes deliberately indifferent to the opposition of good and evil it betrays its function and forfeits all claim to excellence.",
    "The human soul has need of security and also of risk. The fear of violence or of hunger or of any other extreme evil is a sickness of the soul. The boredom produced by a complete absence of risk is also a sickness of the soul.",
    "The mysteries of faith are degraded if they are made into an object of affirmation and negation, when in reality they should be an object of contemplation.",
    "If it were conceivable that in obeying God one should bring about one's own damnation whilst in disobeying him one could be saved, I should still choose the way of obedience.",
    "On reaching a certain degree of pain we lose the world.",
    "One does not play Bach without having done scales. But neither does one play a scale merely for the sake of the scale.",
    "No human being escapes the necessity of conceiving some good outside himself towards which his thought turns in a movement of desire, supplication, and hope.",
    "Those who love a cause are those who love the life which has to be led in order to serve it.",
    "Love consents to all and commands only those who consent. Love is abdication. God is abdication.",
    "When a contradiction is impossible to resolve except by a lie, then we know that it is really a door.",
    "Contradiction itself, far from always being a criterion of error, is sometimes a sign of truth.",
    "We can only know one thing about God - that he is what we are not. Our wretchedness alone is an image of this. The more we contemplate it, the more we contemplate him.",
    "In relation to God, we are like a thief who has burgled the house of a kindly householder and been allowed to keep some of the gold. From the point of view of the lawful owner this gold is a gift; Form the point of view of the burglar it is a theft. He must go and give it back. It is the same with our existence. We have stolen a little of God's being to make it ours. God has made us a gift of it. But we have stolen it. We must return it.",
    "Our science is like a store filled with the most subtle intellectual devices for solving the most complex problems, and yet we are almost incapable of applying the elementary principles of rational thought.",
    "All the Freudian system is impregnated with the prejudice which it makes it its mission to fight -- the prejudice that everything sexual is vile.",
    "Attachment is a manufacturer of illusion and whoever wants reality ought to be detached.",
    "War is the supreme form of prestige.",
    "More than in any other performing arts the lack of respect for acting seems to spring from the fact that every layman considers himself a valid critic.",
    "The simultaneous existence of opposite virtues in the soul like pincers to catch hold of God.",
    "Friendship is a miracle by which a person consents to view from a certain distance, without coming any nearer, the very being who is as necessary to him as food.",
    "Liberty, taking the word in its concrete sense, consists in the ability to choose.",
    "Religion is a form of nourishment. It is difficult to appreciate the flavor and food-value of something one has never eaten.",
    "Every perfect life is a parable invented by God.",
    "Necessity is God's veil.",
    "The joy of learning is as indispensable in study as breathing is in running.",
    "We are only geometricians of matter; the Greeks were, first of all, geometricians in the apprenticeship to virtue.",
    "The Great Beast is the only object of idolatry , the only ersatz of God , the only imitation of something which is infinitely far from me and which is I myself.",
    "Christians ought to suspect that affliction is the very essence of creation. To be a created thing is not necessarily to be afflicted, but it is necessarily to be exposed to affliction. ... Affliction is the surest sign that God wishes to be loved by us; it is the most precious evidence of His tenderness.",
    "To be innocent is to bear the weight of the entire universe. It is to throw away the counterweight.",
    "There can be a true grandeur in any degree of submissiveness, because it springs from loyalty to the laws and to an oath, and not from baseness of soul.",
    "It is only by entering the transcendental, the supernatural, the authentically spiritual order that man rises above the social. Until then, whatever he may do, the social is transcendent in relation to him.",
    "In what concerns divine things, belief is not appropriate.  Only certainty will do.  Anything less than certainty is unworthy of God.",
    "We should do only those righteous actions which we cannot stop ourselves from doing.",
    "The most important part of teaching is to teach what it is to know.",
    "All the goods of this world...are finite and limited and radically incapable of satisfying the desire that perpetually burns within us for an infinite and perfect good.",
    "I would suggest that barbarism be considered as a permanent and universal human characteristic which becomes more or less pronounced according to the play of circumstances.",
    "One can never really give a proof of the reality of anything; reality is not something open to proof, it is something established. It is established just because proof is not enough. It is this characteristic of language, at once indispensable and inadequate, which shows the reality of the external world. Most people hardly ever realize this, because it is rare that the very same man thinks and puts his thought into action.",
    "Concern for the symbol has completely disappeared from our science . And yet, if one were to give oneself the trouble, one could easily find, in certain parts at least of contemporary mathematics... symbols as clear, as beautiful, and as full of spiritual meaning as that of the circle and mediation. From modern thought to ancient wisdom the path would be short and direct, if one cared to take it.",
    "There is nothing that comes closer to true humility than the intelligence. It is impossible to feel pride in one's intelligence at the moment when one really and truly exercises it.",
    "The children of God should not have any other country here below but the universe itself, with the totality of all the reasoning creatures it ever has contained, contains, or ever will contain. That is the native city to which we owe our love.",
    "The Our Father contains all possible petitions; we cannot conceive of any prayer not already contained in it. It is to prayer what Christ is to humanity.",
    "The right to kill: supposing the life of X ... were linked with our own so that the two deaths had to be simultaneous, should we still wish him to die? If with our whole body and soul we desire life and if nevertheless without lying, we can reply 'yes'> then we have the right to kill.",
    "We must prefer real hell to an imaginary paradise.",
    "One might lay down as a postulate: All conceptions of God which are incompatible with a movement of pure charity are false. All other conceptions of him, in varying degree, are true.",
    "As soon as men know that they can kill without fear of punishment or blame, they kill; or at least they encourage killers with approving smiles.",
    "Humility consists of knowing that in this world the whole soul, not only what we term the ego in its totality, but also the supernatural part of the soul, which is God present in it, is subject to time and to the vicissitudes of change. There must be absolutely acceptance of the possibility that everything material in us should be destroyed. But we must simultaneously accept and repudiate the possibility that the supernatural part of the soul should disappear.",
    "Two forces rule the universe: light and gravity.",
    "In a general way, the literature of the twentieth century is essentially psychological; and psychology consists of describing states of the soul by displaying them all on the same plane, without any discrimination of value, as though good and evil were external to them, as though the effort toward the good could be absent at any moment from the thought of any man.",
    "Creation is an act of love and it is perpetual.",
    "He who does not realize to what extent shifting fortune and necessity hold in subjection every human spirit, cannot regard as fellow-creatures nor love as he loves himself those whom chance separated from him by an abyss. The variety of constraints pressing upon man give rise to the illusion of several distinct species that cannot communicate. Only he who has measured the dominion of force, and knows how not to respect it, is capable of love and justice.",
    "The contradictions the mind comes up against, these are the only realities, the criterion of the real. There is no contradiction in what is imaginary. Contradiction is the test of necessity.",
    "A Pharisee is someone who is virtuous out of obedience to the Great Beast.",
    "science has now been for a long time - and to an ever-increasing extent - a collective enterprise. Actually, new results are always, in fact, the work of specific individuals; but, save perhaps for rare exceptions, the value of any result depends on such a complex set of interrelations with past discoveries and possible future researches that even the mind of the inventor cannot embrace the whole.",
    "It is not the cause for which men took up arms that makes a victory more just or less, it is the order that is established when arms have been laid down.",
    "Punishment is a vital need of the human soul.",
    "Whoever is uprooted himself uproots others. Whoever is rooted himself doesn't uproot others.",
    "A man whose mind feels that it is captive would prefer to blind himself to the fact. But if he hates falsehood, he will not do so; and in that case he will have to suffer a lot. He will beat his head against the wall until he faints. He will come to again",
    "It is not enough that France should be regarded as a country which enjoys the remains of a freedom acquired long ago. If she is still to count in the world--and if she does not intend to, she may as well perish--she must be seen by her own citizens and by all men as an ever-flowing source of liberty. There must not be a single genuine lover of freedom in the whole world who can have a valid reason for hating France.",
    "The poison of skepticism becomes, like alcoholism, tuberculosis, and some other diseases, much more virulent in a hitherto virgin soil.",
    "Every new development for the last three centuries has brought men closer to a state of affairs in which absolutely nothing would be recognized in the whole world as possessing a claim to obedience except the authority of the State. The majority of people in Europe obey nothing else.",
    "One could count on one's fingers the number of scientists throughout the world with a general idea of the history and development of their particular science: there is none who is really competent as regards sciences other than his own. As science forms an indivisible whole, one may say that there are no longer, strictly speaking, scientists, but only drudges doing scientific work.",
    "We possess nothing in the world - a mere chance can strip us of everything - except the power to say 'I.",
    "Compassion directed to oneself is humility.",
    "To set up as a standard of public morality a notion which can neither be defined nor conceived is to open the door to every kind of tyranny.",
    "In this world we live in a mixture of time and eternity. Hell would be pure time.",
    "The supernatural virtue of justice consists of behaving exactly as though there were equality when one is the stronger in an unequal relationship.",
    "In the Church, considered as a social organism, the mysteries inevitably degenerate into beliefs.",
    "Someone who does not see a pane of glass is not aware of not seeing it.",
    "Evil is neither suffering nor sin; it is both at the same time, it is something common to them both. For they are linked together; sin makes us suffer and suffering makes us evil, and this indissoluble complex of suffering and sin is the evil in which we are submerged against our will, and to our horror.",
    "It may be that vice, depravity, and crime are nearly always, or even perhaps always, in their essence, attempts to eat beauty, to eat what we should only look at.",
    "A right which goes unrecognized by anybody is not worth very much.",
    "The contemporary form of true greatness lies in a civilization founded upon the spirituality of work.",
    "The whole evolution of present-day society tends to develop the various forms of bureaucratic oppression and to give them a sort of autonomy in regard to capitalism as such.",
    "The villagers seldom leave the village; many scientists have limited and poorly cultivated minds apart from their specialty.",
    "The notion of obligations comes before that of rights, which is subordinate and relative to the former. A right is not effectual by itself, but only in relation to the obligation to which it corresponds.",
    "To be a hero or a heroine, one must give an order to oneself.",
    "To get power over is to defile. To possess is to defile.",
    "The essential thing to know about God is that God is Good.  All the rest is secondary.",
    "Justice, truth, and beauty are sisters and comrades. With three such beautiful words we have no need to look for any others.",
    "Distance is the soul of beauty.",
    "Men owe us what we imagine they will give us. We must forgive them this debt.",
    "The full expression of personality depends upon its being inflated by social prestige; it is a social privilege.",
    "Science is voiceless; it is the scientists who talk.",
    "Petroleum is a more likely cause of international conflict than wheat.",
    "The payment of debts is necessary for social order. The non-payment is quite equally necessary for social order. For centuries humanity has oscillated, serenely unaware, between these two contradictory necessities.",
    "The necessity for power is obvious, because life cannot be lived without order; but the allocation of power is arbitrary because all men are alike, or very nearly. Yet power must not seem to be arbitrarily allocated, because it will not then be recognized as power. Therefore prestige, which is illusion, is of the very essence of power.",
    "The poet produces the beautiful by fixing his attention on something real.",
    "The apprehension of necessity is an imitation of creation.",
    "The speed with which bureaucracy has invaded almost every branch of human activity is something astounding once one thinks about it.",
    "When an apprentice gets hurt, or complains of being tired, the workmen and peasants have this fine expression: \"It is the trade entering his body.\" Each time that we have some pain to go through, we can say to ourselves quite truly that it is the universe, the order and beauty of the world, and the obedience of God that are entering our body.",
    "The essential characteristic of the first half of the twentieth century is the growing weakness, and almost the disappearance, of the idea of value.",
    "Mathematics alone make us feel the limits of our intelligence. For we can always suppose in the case of an experiment that it is inexplicable because we don't happen to have all the data. In mathematics we have all the data, brought together in the full light of demonstration, and yet we don't understand. We always come back to the contemplation of our human wretchedness. What force is in relation to our will, the impenetrable opacity of mathematics is in relation to our intelligence.",
    "One must always be ready to change sides with justice, that fugitive from the winning camp.",
    "Time does us violence; it is the only violence.",
    "Armies under the control of ... a sovereign State cannot bring freedom to anyone.",
    "prayer consists of attention. It is the orientation of all the attention of which the soul is capable towards God. The quality of the attention counts for much in the quality of the prayer. Warmth of heart cannot make up for it.",
    "It is impossible that the whole of truth should not be present at every time and every place, available for anyone who desires it.",
    "Electra weeping for the dead Orestes. If we love God while thinking that he does not exist, he will manifest his existence.",
    "War, which perpetuates itself under the form of preparation for war, has once and for all given the State an important role in production.",
    "During the last quarter of a century all the authority associated with the function of spiritual guidance ... has seeped down into the lowest publications. ... Between a poem by Valéry and an advertisement for a beauty cream promising a rich marriage to anyone who used it there was at no point a breach of continuity. So as a result of literature's spiritual usurpation a beauty cream advertisement possessed, in the eyes of little village girls, the authority that was formerly attached to the words of priests.",
    "Beauty is a fruit which we look at without trying to seize it.",
    "Official history is believing the murderers at their word.",
    "There are two atheisms of which one is a purification of the notion of God.",
    "Conformity is an imitation of grace.",
    "Modern war appears as a struggle led by all the State apparatuses and their general staffs against all men old enough to bear arms.",
    "All the natural movements of the soul are controlled by laws analogous to those of physical gravity. Grace is the only exception. Grace fills empty spaces, but it can only enter where there is a void to receive it, and it is grace itself which makes this void. The imagination is continually at work filling up all the fissures through which grace might pass.",
    "In solitude we are in the presence of mere matter (even the sky, the stars, the moon, trees in blossom), things of less value (perhaps) than a human spirit. Its value lies in the greater possibility of attention.",
    "In the intellectual order, the virtue of humility is nothing more nor less than the power of attention.",
    "Man alone can enslave man.",
    "The same suffering is much harder to bear for a high motive than for a base one. The people [during World War II] who stood motionless, from one to eight in the morning, for the sake of having an egg, would have found it very difficult to do in order to save a human life.",
    "The word 'revolution' is a word for which you kill, for which you die, for which you send the labouring masses to their deaths; but which does not contain any content.",
    "The real sin of idolatry is always committed on behalf of something similar to the State.",
    "The soul is the human being considered as having a value in itself.",
    "If we are suffering illness, poverty, or misfortune, we think we shall be satisfied on the day it ceases. But there too, we know it is false; so soon as one has got used to not suffering one wants something else.",
    "Imagination is always the fabric of social life and the dynamic of history. The influence of real needs and compulsions, of real interests and materials, is indirect because the crowd is never conscious of it.",
    "If a young girl is being forced into a brothel she will not talk about her rights. In such a situation the word would sound ludicrously inadequate.",
    "Contemplating an object fixedly with the mind, asking myself, 'What is it?' without thinking of any other object or relating it to anything else for hours on end.",
    "I only read what I am hungry for at the moment when I have an appetite for it, and then I do not read, I eat.",
    "If there were no affliction in this world we might think we were in paradise.",
    "...nothing on earth can stop man from feeling himself born for liberty. Never, whatever may happen, can he accept servitude; for he is a thinking creature.",
    "The world is the closed door. It is a barrier. And at the same time it is the way through.",
    "Those who keep the masses of men in subjection by exercising force and cruelty deprive them at once of two vital foods, liberty and obedience; for it is no longer within the power of such masses to accord their inner consent to the authority to which they are subjected. Those who encourage a state of things in which the hope of gain is the principle motive take away from men their obedience, for consent which is its essence is not something which can be sold.",
    "Truth is one, but error is manifold.",
    "Why is it that reality, when set down untransposed in a book, sounds false?",
    "To write the lives of the great in separating them from their works necessarily ends by above all stressing their pettiness, because it is in their work that they have put the best of themselves.",
    "An imaginary perfection is automatically at the same level as I who imagine it neither higher nor lower.",
    "We should desire neither the immortality nor the death of any human being, whoever he may be, with whom we have to do.",
    "The man who has known pure joy, if only for a moment ... is the only man for whom affliction is something devastating. At the same time he is the only man who has not deserved the punishment. But, after all, for him it is no punishment; it is God holding his hand and pressing rather hard. For, if he remains constant, what he will discover buried deep under the sound of his own lamentations is the pearl of the silence of God.",
    "Algebra and money are essentially levelers; the first intellectually, the second effectively.",
    "Nothing can have as its destination anything other than its origin. The contrary idea, the idea of progress, is poison.",
    "Our patriotism comes straight from the Romans. This is why French children are encouraged to seek inspiration for it in Corneille. It is a pagan virtue, if these two words are compatible. The word pagan, when applied to Rome, early possesses the significance charged with horror which the early Christian controversialists gave it. The Romans really were an atheistic and idolatrous people; not idolatrous with regard to images made of stone or bronze, but idolatrous with regard to themselves. It is this idolatry of self which they have bequeathed to us in the form of patriotism.",
    "School children and students who love God should never say: \"For my part I like mathematics\"; \"I like French\"; \"I like Greek.\" They should learn to like all these subjects, because all of them develop that faculty of attention which, directed toward God, is the very substance of prayer.",
    "The lure of quantity is the most dangerous of all.",
    "The only hope of socialism resides in those who have already brought about in themselves, as far as is possible in the society of today, that union between manual and intellectual labor which characterizes the society we are aiming at.",
    "There is a certain kind of morality which is even more alien to good and evil than amorality is.",
    "Life does not need to mutilate itself in order to be pure.",
    "The real stumbling-block of totalitarian regimes is not the spiritual need of men for freedom of thought; it is men's inability to stand the physical and nervous strain of a permanent state of excitement, except during a few years of their youth.",
    "Meditation on the chance which led to the meeting of my mother and father is even more salutary than meditation on death.",
    "The joy of learning is as indispensable in study as breathing is in running. Where it is lacking there are no real students, but only poor caricatures of apprentices who, at the end of their apprenticeship, will not even have a trade.",
    "Purity is the power to contemplate defilement.",
    "Whenever a human being, through the commission of a crime, has become exiled from good, he needs to be reintegrated with it through suffering. The suffering should be inflicted with the aim of bringing the soul to recognize freely some day that its infliction was just.",
    "Intellectual adherence is never owed to anything whatsoever, for it is never in any degree a voluntary thing. Attention alone is voluntary. It alone forms the subject of an obligation.",
    "Rome is the Great Beast of atheism and materialism, adoring nothing but itself. Israel is the Great Beast of religion. Neither one nor the other is likable. The Great Beast is always repulsive",
    "Art has no immediate future, because all art is collective and there is no more collective life.",
    "Attentiveness is the heart of prayer.",
    "In order to obey God, one must receive his commands. How did it happen that I received them in adolescence, while I was professing atheism? To believe that the desire for good is always fulfilled - that is faith, and whoever has it is not an atheist.",
    "We are like horses who hurt themselves as soon as they pull on their bits - and we bow our heads. We even lose consciousness of the situation, we just submit. Any re-awakening of thought is then painful.",
    "The whole of our civilization is founded on specialization, which implies the enslavement of those who execute to those who coordinate.",
    "Academic work is one of those fields which contain a pearl so precious that it is worth while to sell all our possessions, keeping nothing for ourselves, in order to be able to acquire it.",
    "The authentic and pure values, truth, beauty, and goodness, in the activity of a human being are the result of one and the same act, a certain application of the full attention to the object. Teaching should have no aim but to prepare, by training the attention, for the possibility of such an act. All the other advantages of instruction are without interest.",
    "We must love all facts, not for their consequences, but because in each fact God is there present.",
    "Only an indirect method is effective. We do nothing if we have not first drawn back.",
    "Who were the fools who spread the story that brute force cannot kill ideas? Nothing is easier. And once they are dead they are no more than corpses.",
    "Whatever debases the intelligence degrades the entire human being.",
    "Every time that I think of the crucifixion of Christ, I commit the sin of envy.",
    "Renunciation is submission to time.",
    "The role of the intelligence - that part of us which affirms and denies and formulates opinions is merely to submit.",
    "The development of the faculty of attention forms the real object and almost the sole interest of studies.",
    "We must wish either for that which actually exists or for that which cannot in any way exist or, still better, for both. That which is and that which cannot be are both outside the realm of becoming.",
    "The only great spirit of our time.",
    "the instruments of power - arms, gold, machines, magical or technical secrets - always exist independently of him who disposes of them, and can be taken up by others. Consequently all power is unstable.",
    "Capitalism has brought about the emancipation of collective humanity with respect to nature. But this collective humanity has itself taken on with respect to the individual the oppressive function formerly exercised by nature.",
    "Most works of art, like most wines, ought to be consumed in the district of their fabrication.",
    "The notion of rights is linked with the notion of sharing out, of exchange, of measured quantity. It has a commercial flavor, essentially evocative of legal claims and arguments. Rights are always asserted in a tone of contention; and when this tone is adopted, it must rely upon force in the background, or else it will be laughed at.",
    "Christ himself came down and took possession of me. . . I had never foreseen the possibility of that, of a real contact, person to person, here below, between a human being and God. . . in this sudden possession of me by Christ, neither my sense nor my imagination had any part:  I only felt in the midst of my suffering the presence of a love.",
    "A society like the Church, which claims to be Divine is perhaps more dangerous on account of the ersatz good which it contains then on account of the evil which sullies it. Something of the social labelled divine: an intoxicating mixture which carries with it every sort of license. Devil disguised.",
    "Evil is license, and that is why it is monotonous: everything has to be drawn from ourselves. One is condemned to false infinity. That is hell itself.",
    "There is no detachment where there is no pain. And there is no pain endured without hatred or lying unless detachment is present too.",
    "A self-respecting nation is ready for anything, including war, except for a renunciation of its option to make war.",
    "Nothing is less instructive than a machine.",
    "A doctrine serves no purpose in itself, but it is indispensable to have one if only to avoid being deceived by false doctrines.",
    "one is never got out of the cave, one comes out of it.",
    "A well ordered society would be one where the State only had a negative action, comparable to that of a rudder: a light pressure at the right moment to counteract the first suggestion of any loss of equilibrium.",
    "[We are not] to take one step, even in the direction of what is good, beyond that to which we are irresistibly impelled by God, and this applies to action, word, and thought."
