    "We are not fond of praising, and never praise any one except from interested motives. Praise is a clever, concealed, and delicate flattery, which gratifies in different ways the giver and the receiver.

    "The dullness of certain people is sometimes a sufficient security against the attack of an artful man.",
    "Friendship is insipid to those who have experienced love.",

    "The heart of man ever finds a constant succession of passions, so that the destroying and pulling down of one proves generally tobe nothing else but the production and the setting up of another.",
    "The passions do very often give birth to others of a nature most contrary to their own. Thus avarice sometimes brings forth prodigality, and prodigality avarice; a man's resolution is very often the effect of levity, and his boldness that of cowardice and fear.",
    "The passions of youth are not more dangerous to health than is the lukewarmness of old age.",

    "Constancy in love is of two sorts: One is the effect of new excellencies that are always presenting themselves afresh, and attractour affections continually; the other is only from a point of honor, and a taking of pride not to change.",

    "What we take for high-mindedness is very often no other than ambition well disguised, that scorns means interests, only to pursuegreater.",
    "Humility is often only the putting on of a submissiveness by which men hope to bring other people to submit to them; it is a morecalculated sort of pride, which debases itself with a design of being exalted; and though this vice transform itself into a thousand several shapes, yet the disguise is never more effectual nor more capable of deceiving the world than when concealed under a form of humility.",

    "The breeding we give young people is ordinarily but an additional self-love, by which we make them have a better opinion of themselves.",
    "The cunningest dissimulation is when a man pretends to be caught in the traps others set for him; and a man is never so easily over-reached as when he is contriving to over-reach others.",

    "The most effectual way to be deceived is to believe oneself more cunning than one's neighbors.",

    "There is something to be said for jealousy, because it only designs the preservation of some good which we either have or think wehave a right to. But envy is a raging madness that cannot bear the wealth or fortune of others.",

    "Preserving the serious health condition is usually painful.",
    "It is a mistake to imagine, that the violent passions only, such as ambition and love, can triumph over the rest. Idleness, languid as it is, often masters them all; she influences all our designs and actions, and insensibly consumes and destroys both passions and virtues.",

    "He is safe who admits no one to his confidence.",
    "For the credit of virtue we must admit that the greatest misfortunes of men are those into which they fall through their crimes.",
    "Nothing is so contagious as example; never was there any considerable good or ill done that does not produce its like. We imitate good actions through emulation, and had ones through a malignity in our nature, which shame conceals, and example sets at liberty.",

    "Our wisdom lies as much at the mercy of fortune as our possessions do.",
    "There is an excess both in happiness and misery above our power of sensation.",
    "Happiness does not consist in things themselves but in the relish we have of them; and a man has attained it when he enjoys what he loves and desires himself, and not what other people think lovely and desirable.",
    "Men's happiness and misery depends altogether as much upon their own humor as it does upon fortune.",
    "What we take for virtue is often but an assemblage of various ambitions and activities that chance, or our own astuteness, have arranged in a certain manner; and it is not always out of courage or purity that men are brave, and women chaste.",
    "If one judges love according to the greatest part of the effects it produces, it would appear to resemble rather hatred than kindness.",
    "As long as we love, we can forgive.",
    "Self-love makes our friends appear more or less deserving in proportion to the delight we take in them, and the measures by whichwe judge of their worth depend upon the manner of their conversing with us.",

    "As uncommon a thing as true love is, it is yet easier to find than true friendship.",
    "The reason we do not let our friends see the very bottom of our hearts is not so much distrust of them as distrust of ourselves.",
    "The thing that makes our friendships so short and changeable is that the qualities and dispositions of the soul are very hard to know, and those of the understanding and wit very easy.",
    "Truth has scarce done so much good in the world as the false appearances of it have done hurt.",
    "When the philosophers despised riches, it was because they had a mind to vindicate their own merit, and take revenge upon the injustice of fortune by vilifying those enjoyments which she had not given them.",
    "The fondness or indifference that the philosophers expressed for life was merely a preference inspired by their self-love, and will no more bear reasoning upon than the relish of the palate or the choice of colors.",
    "The distempers of the soul have their relapses, as many and as dangerous as those of the body; and what we take for a perfect cureis generally either an abatement of the same disease or the changing of that for another.",
    "We should desire very few things passionately if we did but perfectly know the nature of the things we desire.",

    "Generally speaking, we would make a good bargain by renouncing all the good that people say of us, upon condition they would say no ill.",
    "We do not like to praise, and seldom praise anyone without self-interest.",
    "We often make use of envenomed praise, that reveals on the rebound, as it were, defects in those praised which we dare not exposeany other way.",
    "That man, we may be sure, is a person of true worth, whom those who envy him most are yet forced to praise.",
    "Criticism sometimes is really praise, and praise sometimes slander.",
    "Praise is a more ingenious, concealed, and subtle kind of flattery, that satisfies both the giver and the receiver, though by verydifferent ways. The one accepts it as a reward due to his merit; the other gives it that he may be looked upon as a just and discerning person.",
    "Pride has a greater share than goodness in the reproofs we give other people for their faults; and we chide them not so much to make them mend those faults as to make them believe that we ourselves are without fault.",

    "A weak mind is the only defect out of our power to mend.",
    "Some good qualities are like the senses: Those who are entirely deprived of them can have no notion of them.",
    "It is often hard to determine whether a clear, open, and honorable proceeding is the result of goodness or of cunning.",
