    "If I believe in God and life after death and you do not, and if there is no God, we both lose when we die. However, if there is a God, you still lose and I gain everything.",
    "Truth is so obscure in these times, and falsehood so established, that, unless we love the truth, we cannot know it.",
    "There is a God shaped vacuum in the heart of every man which cannot be filled by any created thing, but only by God, the Creator, made known through Jesus.",
    "Don't try to add more years to your life. Better add more life to your years.",
    "People almost invariably arrive at their beliefs not on the basis of proof but on the basis of what they find attractive.",
    "Either Christianity is true or it's false. If you bet that it's true, and you believe in God and submit to Him, then if it IS true, you've gained God, heaven, and everything else. If it's false, you've lost nothing, but you've had a good life marked by peace and the illusion that ultimately, everything makes sense. If you bet that Christianity is not true, and it's false, you've lost nothing. But if you bet that it's false, and it turns out to be true, you've lost everything and you get to spend eternity in hell.",
    "All men's miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone.",
    "In difficult times carry something beautiful in your heart.",
    "There are only three types of people; those who have found God and serve him; those who have not found God and seek him, and those who live not seeking, or finding him. The first are rational and happy; the second unhappy and rational, and the third foolish and unhappy.",
    "The more I see of Mankind, the more I prefer my dog.",
    "We must learn our limits. We are all something, but none of us are everything.",
    "Knowing God without knowing our own wretchedness makes for pride. Knowing our own wretchedness without knowing God makes for despair. Knowing Jesus Christ strikes the balance because he shows us both God and our own wretchedness.",
    "Once your soul has been enlarged by a truth, it can never return to its original size.",
    "I bring you the gift of these four words: I believe in you.",
    "Mankind suffers from two excesses: to exclude reason, and to live by nothing but reason.",
    "Man's greatness lies in his power of thought.",
    "Love knows no limit to its endurance, no end to its trust, no fading of its hope; it can outlast anything. Love still stands when all else has fallen.",
    "We are not satisfied with real life; we want to live some imaginary life in the eyes of other people and to seem different from what we actually are.",
    "There is a God-shaped vacuum in every heart.",
    "The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing.",
    "There are only two kinds of men: the righteous who think they are sinners and the sinners who think they are righteous.",
    "Most of man's trouble comes from his inability to be still.",
    "Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.",
    "Happiness is neither within us, nor without us. It is in the union of ourselves with God.",
    "Distraction is the only thing that consoles us for our miseries. Yet it is itself the greatest of our miseries.",
    "When intuition and logic agree, you are always right.",
    "We should seek the truth without hesitation; and, if we refuse it, we show that we value the esteem of men more than the search for truth.",
    "Kind words do not cost much. They never blister the tongue or lips. They make other people good-natured. They also produce their own image on men's souls, and a beautiful image it is.",
    "It is the heart which perceives God and not the reason. That is what faith is: God perceived by the heart, not by the reason.",
    "Kind words do not cost much. Yet they accomplish much.",
    "Muhammad established a religion by putting his enemies to death; Jesus Christ by commanding his followers to lay down their lives.",
    "It's not those who write the laws that have the greatest impact on society. It's those who write the songs.",
    "If you want to be a real seeker of truth, you need to, at least once in your lifetime, doubt in, as much as it's possible, in everything.",
    "I rather live as if God exists to find out that He doesn't than live as if he doesn't exist to find out He does.",
    "Do you wish people to think well of you? Don't speak well of yourself.",
    "Small minds are concerned with the extraordinary, great minds with the ordinary.",
    "The God of Christians is a God of love and comfort, a God who fills the soul and heart of those whom he possesses, a God who makes them conscious of their inward wretchedness, and his infinite mercy; who unites himself to their inmost soul, who fills it with humility and joy, with confidence and love, who renders them incapable of any other end than himself.",
    "Not only do we know God by Jesus Christ alone, but we know ourselves only by Jesus Christ. We know life and death only through Jesus Christ. Apart from Jesus Christ, we do not know what is our life, nor our death, nor God, nor ourselves.",
    "Imagination decides everything.",
    "Let each of us examine his thoughts; he will find them wholly concerned with the past or the future. We almost never think of the present, and if we do think of it, it is only to see what light is throws on our plans for the future. The present is never our end. The past and the present are our means, the future alone our end. Thus we never actually live, but hope to live, and since we are always planning how to be happy, it is inevitable that we should never be so.",
    "And is it not obvious that, just as it is a crime to disturb the peace when truth reigns, it is also a crime to remain at peace when the truth is being destroyed?",
    "Nothing gives rest but the sincere search for truth.",
    "Lord, help me to do great things as though they were little, since I do them with your power; And little things as though they were great, since I do them in your name!",
    "Anyone who does not see the vanity of the world is very vain himself. So who does not see it, apart from young people whose lives are all noise, diversions, and thoughts for the future? But take away their diversion and you will see them bored to extinction. Then they feel their nullity without recognizing it, for nothing could be more wretched than to be intolerably depressed as soon as one is reduced to introspection with no means of diversion.",
    "There is enough light for those who only desire to see, and enough obscurity for those who have a contrary disposition",
    "Cold words freeze people, and hot words scorch them, and bitter words make them bitter, and wrathful words make them wrathful. Kind words also produce their own image on men's souls; and a beautiful image it is. They smooth, and quiet, and comfort the hearer.",
    "Man is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness from which he emerges and the infinity in which he is engulfed.",
    "We never love a person, but only qualities.",
    "All the maxims have been written. It only remains to put them into practice.",
    "Belief is a wise wager. Granted that faith cannot be proved, what harm will come to you if you gamble on its truth and it proves false? If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation, that He exists.",
    "All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever different means they employ, they all tend to this end. The cause of some going to war, and of others avoiding it, is the same desire in both, attended with different views. The will never takes the least step but to this object. This is the motive of every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves.",
    "There are two excesses: to exclude reason, to admit nothing but reason. The supreme achievement of reason is to realise that there is a limit to reason. Reason's last step is the recognition that there are an infinite number of things which are beyond it. It is merely feeble if it does not go as far as to realise that.",
    "When everyone is moving towards depravity, no one seems to be moving, but if someone stops he shows up the others who are rushing on, by acting as a fixed point.",
    "The strength of a man's virtue should not be measured by his special exertions, but by his habitual acts.",
    "Human beings must be known to be loved; but Divine beings must be loved to be known.",
    "In faith there is enough light for those who want to believe and enough shadows to blind those who don't.",
    "One-half of the ills of life come because men are unwilling to sit down quietly for thirty minutes to think through all the possible consequences of their acts.",
    "All our dignity lies in our thoughts.",
    "Men despise religion. They hate it and are afraid it may be true.",
    "If you want others to have a good opinion of you, say nothing.",
    "If we let ourselves believe that man began with divine grace, that he forfeited this by sin, and that he can be redeemed only by divine grace through the crucified Christ, then we shall find peace of mind never granted to philosophers. He who cannot believe is cursed, for he reveals by his unbelief that God has not chosen to give him grace.",
    "Man is obviously made for thinking. Therein lies all his dignity and his merit; and his whole duty is to think as he ought.",
    "Men despise religion. They hate it and are afraid it may be true. The cure for this is first to show that religion is not contrary to reason, but worthy of reverence and respect. Next make it attractive, make good men wish it were true and then show that it is.",
    "If you do not love too much, you do not love enough.",
    "Faith is different from proof; the latter is human, the former is a Gift from God.",
    "Happiness can be found neither in ourselves nor in external things, but in God and in ourselves as united to him.",
    "Love has reasons which reason cannot understand.",
    "Curiosity is only vanity. We usually only want to know something so that we can talk about it.",
    "Reflect on death as in Jesus Christ, not as without Jesus Christ. Without Jesus Christ it is dreadful, it is alarming, it is the terror of nature. In Jesus Christ it is fair and lovely, it is good and holy, it is the joy of saints.",
    "If I had more time I would write a shorter letter.",
    "Justice without force is powerless; force without justice is tyrannical.",
    "All the trouble in the world is due to the fact that man cannot sit still in a room.",
    "The supreme function of reason is to show man that some things are beyond reason.",
    "What part of us feels pleasure? Is it our hand, our arm, our flesh, or our blood? It must obviously be something immaterial.",
    "We know that there is an infinite, and we know not its nature. As we know it to be false that numbers are finite, it is therefore true that there is a numerical infinity. But we know not of what kind; it is untrue that it is even, untrue that it is odd; for the addition of a unit does not change its nature; yet it is a number, and every number is odd or even (this certainly holds of every finite number). Thus we may quite well know that there is a God without knowing what He is.",
    "If a man is not made for God, why is he happy only in God?",
    "Faith is a sounder guide than reason. Reason can only go so far, but faith has no limits.",
    "Christian piety annihilates the egoism of the heart; worldly politeness veils and represses it.",
    "Having been unable to strengthen justice, we have justified strength.",
    "(Man,) the glory and the scandal of the universe.",
    "Silence.  All human unhappiness comes from not knowing how to stay quietly in a room.",
    "Mutual cheating is the foundation of society.",
    "Good deeds, when concealed, are the most admirable.",
    "What reason have atheists for saying that we cannot rise again? That what has never been, should be, or that what has been, should be again? Is it more difficult to come into being than to return to it.",
    "Human life is thus only an endless illusion. Men deceive and flatter each other. No one speaks of us in our presence as he does when we are gone. Society is based on mutual hypocrisy.",
    "All of our reasoning ends in surrender to feeling.",
    "The more intelligent a man is, the more originality he discovers in others.",
    "The heart has its reasons which reason knows nothing of... We know the truth not only by the reason, but by the heart.\" - Blaise Pascal",
    "Nothing is so intolerable to man as being fully at rest, without a passion, without business, without entertainment, without care.",
    "Not only do we know God through Jesus Christ, we only know ourselves through Jesus Christ.",
    "Clarity of mind means clarity of passion, too; this is why a great and clear mind loves ardently and sees distinctly what it loves.",
    "The Christian religion teaches me two points-that there is a God whom men can know, and that their nature is so corrupt that they are unworthy of Him.",
    "What a difficult thing it is to ask someone's advice on a matter without coloring his judgment by the way in which we present our problem.",
    "You always admire what you really don't understand.",
    "Everyone, without exception, is searching for happiness.",
    "Death itself is less painful when it comes upon us unawares than the bare contemplation of it, even when danger is far distant.",
    "Human beings do not know their place and purpose. They have fallen from their true place, and lost their true purpose. They search everywhere for their place and purpose, with great anxiety. But they cannot find them because they are surrounded by darkness.",
    "Fear not, provided you fear; but if you fear not, then fear.",
    "Passion cannot be beautiful without excess; one either loves too much or not enough.",
    "Kind words produce their images on men's souls.",
    "Noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed.",
    "Wisdom leads us back to childhood.",
    "What a vast difference there is between knowing God and loving Him.",
    "Jesus was in a garden, not of delight as the first Adam, in which he destroyed himself and the whole human race, but in one of agony, in which he saved himself and the whole human race.",
    "Amusement that is excessive and followed only for its own sake, allures and deceives us.",
    "Unless we love the truth we cannot know it.",
    "Plurality which is not reduced to unity is confusion; unity which does not depend on plurality is tyranny.",
    "Man's sensitivity to the little things and insensitivity to the greatest are the signs of a strange disorder.",
    "A man does not show his greatness by being at one extremity, but rather by touching both at once.",
    "The entire ocean is affected by a single pebble.",
    "No one is discontented at not being a king except a discrowned king ... unhappiness almost invariably indicates the existence of a road not taken, a talent undeveloped, a self not recognized.",
    "Words differently arranged have a different meaning, and meanings differently arranged have different effects.",
    "Without Jesus Christ man must be in vice and misery with Jesus Christ man is free from vice and misery in Him is all our virtue and all our happiness. Apart from Him there is but vice, misery, darkness, death, despair.",
    "Force rules the world-not opinion; but it is opinion that makes use of force.",
    "To understand is to forgive.",
    "The captain of a ship is not chosen from those of the passengers who comes from the best family.",
    "Instead of complaining that God had hidden himself, you will give Him thanks for having revealed so much of Himself.",
    "Fashion is a tyrant from which nothing frees us. We must suit ourselves to its fantastic tastes. But being compelled to live under its foolish laws, the wise man is never the first to follow, nor the last to keep it.",
    "There are two equally dangerous extremes-to shut reason out, and to let nothing else in.",
    "Nature imitates herself. A grain thrown into good ground brings forth fruit; a principle thrown into a good mind brings forth fruit. Everything is created and conducted by the same Master-the root, the branch, the fruits-the principles, the consequences.",
    "There is nothing that we can see on earth which does not either show the wretchedness of man or the mercy of God. One either sees the powerlessness of man without God, or the strength of man with God.",
    "Evil is easy, and has infinite forms.",
    "Jesus Christ came to tell men that they have no enemies but themselves.",
    "Faith is a gift of God.",
    "No religion except ours has taught that man is born in sin; none of the philosophical sects has admitted it; none therefore has spoken the truth",
    "What can be seen on earth points to neither the total absence nor the obvious presence of divinity, but to the presence of a hidden God. Everything bears this mark.",
    "When we would show any one that he is mistaken, our best course is to observe on what side he considers the subject,--for his view of if is generally right on this side,--and admit to him that he is right so far. He will be satisfied with this acknowledgment, that he was not wrong in his judgment, but only inadvertent in not looking at the whole case.",
    "If god does not exist, one loses nothing by believing in him anyway, while if he does exist, one stands to lose everything by not believing.",
    "Either God exists or He doesn't. Either I believe in God or I don't. Of the four possibilities, only one is to my disadvantage. To avoid that possibility, I believe in God.",
    "It is impossible on reasonable grounds to disbelieve miracles.",
    "Chess is the gymnasium of the mind.",
    "So we can only know God well by knowing our iniquities. Therefore those who have known God, without knowing their wretchedness, have not glorified Him, but have glorified themselves.",
    "It is dangerous to explain too clearly to man how like he is to the animals without pointing out his greatness. It is also dangerous to make too much of his greatness without his vileness. It is still more dangerous to leave him in ignorance of both, but it is most valuable to represent both to him. Man must not be allowed to believe that he is equal either to animals or to angels, nor to be unaware of either, but he must know both.",
    "Eloquence is a way of saying things in such a way, first, that those to whom we speak may listen to them without pain and with pleasure, and second, that they feel themselves interested, so that self-love leads them more willingly to reflection upon it.",
    "All men seek happiness. There are no exceptions.... This is the motive of every act of every man, including those who go and hang themselves.",
    "If God exists, not seeking God must be the gravest error imaginable. If one decides to sincerely seek for God and doesn't find God, the lost effort is negligible in comparison to what is at risk in not seeking God in the first place.",
    "Can anything be stupider than that a man has the right to kill me because he lives on the other side of a river and his ruler has a quarrel with mine, though I have not quarrelled with him?",
    "In each action we must look beyond the action at our past, present, and future state, and at others whom it affects, and see the relations of all those things. And then we shall be very cautious.",
    "No man ever believes with a true and saving faith unless God inclines his heart; and no man when God does incline his heart can refrain from believing.",
    "I do not admire a virtue like valour when it is pushed to excess, if I do not see at the same time the excess of the opposite virtue, as one does in Epaminondas, who displayed extreme valour and extreme benevolence. For otherwise it is not an ascent, but a fall. We do not display our greatness by placing ourselves at one extremity, but rather by being at both at the same time, and filling up the whole of the space between them.",
    "Those are weaklings who know the truth and uphold it as long as it suits their purpose, and then abandon it.",
    "All the troubles of life come upon us because we refuse to sit quietly for a while each day in our rooms.",
    "There is a God-shaped hole in the life of every man.",
    "There are two kinds of people one can call reasonable: those who serve God with all their heart because they know him, and those who seek him with all their heart because they do not know him.",
    "We must kill them in war, just because they live beyond the river. If they lived on this side, we would be called murderers.",
    "The man who knows God but does not know his own misery, becomes proud. The man who knows his own misery but does not know God, ends in despair...the knowledge of Jesus Christ constitutes the middle course because in him we find both God and our own misery. Jesus Christ is therefore a God whom we approach without pride, and before whom we humble ourselves without despair.",
    "Apart from Jesus Christ, we do not know what is our life, nor our death, nor God, nor ourselves.",
    "To ridicule philosophy is really to philosophize.",
    "Thought makes the whole dignity of man; therefore endeavor to think well, that is the only morality.",
    "Our achievements of today are but the sum total of our thoughts of yesterday. You are today where the thoughts of yesterday have brought you and you will be tomorrow where the thoughts of today take you.",
    "The property of power is to protect.",
    "When I see the blind and wretched state of men, when I survey the whole universe in its deadness, and man left to himself with no light, as though lost in this corner of the universe without knowing who put him there, what he has to do, or what will become of him when he dies, incapable of knowing anything, I am moved to terror, like a man transported in his sleep to some terrifying desert island, who wakes up quite lost, with no means of escape. Then I marvel that so wretched a state does not drive people to despair.",
    "The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.",
    "It is not certain that everything is uncertain.",
    "Our soul is cast into a body, where it finds number, time, dimension. Thereupon it reasons, and calls this nature necessity, and can believe nothing else.",
    "Nothing is so intolerable to man as being fully at rest, without passion, without business, without entertainment, without care. It is then that he recognizes that he is empty, insufficient, dependent, ineffectual. From the depths of his soul now comes at once boredom, gloom, sorrow, chagrin, resentment and despair.",
    "There are people who lie simply for the sake of lying.",
    "One of the greatest artifices the devil uses to engage men in vice and debauchery, is to fasten names of contempt on certain virtues, and thus fill weak souls with a foolish fear of passing for scrupulous, should they desire to put them in practice.",
    "Bless yourself with holy water, have Masses said, and so on; by a simple and natural process this will make you believe, and will dull you - will quiet your proudly critical intellect.",
    "Let man reawake and consider what he is compared with the reality of things; regard himself lost in this remote corner of Nature; and from the tiny cell where he lodges, to wit the Universe, weigh at their true worth earth, kingdoms, towns, himself. What is a man face to face with infinity?",
    "Too much and too little wine. Give him none, he cannot find truth; give him too much, the same.",
    "The incredulous are the more credulous. They believe the miracles of Vespasian that they may not believe those of Moses.\n[Fr., Incredules les plus credules. Ils croient les miracle de Vespasien, pour ne pas croire ceux de Moise.]",
    "Kind words produce their own image in men's souls; and a beautiful image it is. They soothe and quiet and comfort the hearer. They shame him out of his sour, morose, unkind feelings. We have not yet begun to use kind words in such abundance as they ought to be used.",
    "Parents fear the destruction of natural affection in their children. What is this natural principle so liable to decay? Habit is a second nature, which destroys the first. Why is not custom nature? I suspect that this nature itself is but a first custom, as custom is a second nature.",
    "If men knew themselves, God would heal and pardon them.",
    "It has pleased God that divine verities should not enter the heart through the understanding, but the understanding through the heart.",
    "Habit is a second nature, which destroys the first.",
    "When I have occasionally set myself to consider the different distractions of men, the pains and perils to which they expose themselves I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber.",
    "Jesus is the God whom we can approach without pride and before whom we can humble ourselves without despair.",
    "L'homme n'est ni ange ni be\"  te, et le malheur veut que qui veut faire l'ange fait la be\"  te. Man is neither angel nor beast.Unfortunately, he who wants to act the angel often acts the beast.",
    "If it is an extraordinary blindness to live without investigating what we are, it is a terrible one to live an evil life, while believing in God",
    "The manner in which Epictetus, Montaigne, and Salomon de Tultie wrote, is the most usual, the most suggestive, the most remembered, and the oftener quoted; because it is entirely composed of thoughts born from the common talk of life.",
    "The gospel to me is simply irresistible.",
    "How can anyone lose who chooses to become a Christian? If, when he dies, there turns out to be no God and his faith was in vain, he has lost nothing...If, however, there is a God and a heaven and a hell. then he has gained heaven and his skeptical friends have lost everything.",
    "Man lives between the infinitely large and the infinitely small.",
    "Il est non seulement impossible, mais inutile de conna|\"tre Dieu sans Je  sus-Christ. It is not only impossible, but also useless to recognize God without Jesus.",
    "Little things console us because little things afflict us.",
    "The art of subversion, of revolution, is to dislodge established customs by probing down to their origins in order to show how they lack authority and justice.",
    "When one does not love too much, one does not love enough.",
    "All the excesses, all the violence, and all the vanity of great men, come from the fact that they know not what they are: it being difficult for those who regard themselves at heart as\nequal with all men... For this it is necessary for one to forget himself, and to believe that he has some real excellence above them, in which consists this illusion that I am endeavoring to\ndiscover to you.",
    "Just as all things speak about God to those that know Him, and reveal Him to those that love Him, they also hide Him from all those that neither seek nor know Him.",
    "[Unbelievers] think they have made great efforts to get at the truth when they have spent a few hours in reading some book out of Holy Scripture, and have questioned some cleric about the truths of the faith. After that, they boast that they have searched in books and among men in vain.",
    "I maintain that, if everyone knew what others said about him, there would not be four friends in the world.",
    "The sensitivity of men to small matters, and their indifference to great ones, indicates a strange inversion.",
    "We view things not only from different sides, but with different eyes; we have no wish to find them alike.",
    "The greatest single distinguishing feature of the omnipotence of God is that our imagination gets lost thinking about it.",
    "Let us imagine a number of men in chains and all condemned to death, where some are killed each day in the sight of the others, and those who remain see their own fate in that of their fellows and wait their turn, looking at each other sorrowfully and without hope. It is an image of the condition of man.",
    "The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing. We feel it in a thousand things. I say that the heart naturally loves the Universal Being, and naturally loves itself; and it gives itself to one or the other, and hardens itself against one or the other, as it chooses...it is the heart that feels God, not the reason; this is faith.",
    "God only pours out his light into the mind after having subdued the rebellion of the will by an altogether heavenly gentleness which charms and wins it.",
    "We know truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart.",
    "Nothing is so important to man as his own state; nothing is so formidable to him as eternity. And thus it is unnatural that thereshould be men indifferent to the loss of their existence and to the perils of everlasting suffering.",
    "We think very little of time present; we anticipate the future, as being too slow, and with a view to hasten it onward, we recall the past to stay it as too swiftly gone. We are so thoughtless, that we thus wander through the hours which are not here, regardless only of the moment that is actually our own.",
    "We implore the mercy of God, not that He may leave us at peace in our vices, but that He may deliver us from them.",
    "Continuous eloquence wearies.",
    "Silence is the greatest persecution; never do the saints keep themselves silent.",
    "Vanity is but the surface.",
    "Time heals griefs and quarrels, for we change and are no longer the same persons. Neither the offender nor the offended are any more themselves.",
    "The principles of pleasure are not firm and stable. They are different in all mankind, and variable in every particular with such a diversity that there is no man more different from\nanother than from himself at different times.",
    "For nature is an image of Grace, and visible miracles are images of the invisible.",
    "The immortality of the soul is a matter which is of so great consequence to us and which touches us so profoundly that we must have lost all feeling to be indifferent about it.",
    "The only shame is to have none.",
    "No one is offended at not seeing everything; but one does not like to be mistaken, and that perhaps arises from the fact that man naturally cannot see everything, and that naturally he cannot err in the side he looks at, since the perceptions of our senses are always true.",
    "The greatness of man is so evident that it is even proved by his wretchedness. For what in animals is nature, we call in man wretchedness--by which we recognize that, his nature being now like that of animals, he has fallen from a better nature which once was his.",
    "Dull minds are never either intuitive or mathematical.",
    "For after all what is man in nature? A nothing in relation to infinity, all in relation to nothing, a central point between nothing and all and infinitely far from understanding either. The ends of things and their beginnings are impregnably concealed from him in an impenetrable secret. He is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness out of which he was drawn and the infinite in which he is engulfed.",
    "Man is to himself the most wonderful object in nature; for he cannot conceive what the body is, still less what the mind is, and least of all how a body should be united to a mind. This is\n the consummation of his difficulties, and yet it is his very being.",
    "If we examine our thoughts, we shall find them always occupied with the past or the future.",
    "I feel engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces whereof I know nothing, and which know nothing of me, I am terrified The eternal silence of these infinite spaces alarms me.",
    "The heart has arguments with which the logic of mind is not aquainted.",
    "The mind naturally makes progress, and the will naturally clings to objects; so that for want of right objects, it will attach itself to wrong ones.",
    "The struggle alone pleases us, not the victory.",
    "We must keep our thought secret, and judge everything by it, while talking like the people.",
    "All I know is that I must soon die, but what I know least is this very death which I cannot escape.",
    "St. Augustine teaches us that there is in each man a Serpent, an Eve, and an Adam. Our senses and natural propensities are the Serpent; the excitable desire is the Eve; and reason is the Adam. Our nature tempts us perpetually; criminal desire is often excited; but sin is not completed till reason consents.",
    "If ignorance were bliss, he'd be a blister",
    "The last function of reason is to recognize that there are an infinity of things which surpass it.",
    "The past and present are only our means; the future is always our end. Thus we never really live, but only hope to live.",

    "We are only falsehood, duplicity, contradiction; we both conceal and disguise ourselves from ourselves.",
    "We do not weary of eating and sleeping every day, for hunger and sleepiness recur. Without that we should weary of them. So, without the hunger for spiritual things, we weary of them. Hunger after righteousness--the eighth beatitude.",
    "The greater intellect one has, the more originality one finds in men. Ordinary persons find no difference between men.",
    "We conceal it from ourselves in vain - we must always love something. In those matters seemingly removed from love, the feeling is secretly to be found, and man cannot possibly live for a moment without it.",
    "If a man loves a woman for her beauty, does he love her? No; for the smallpox, which destroys her beauty without killing her, causes his love to cease. And if any one loves me for my judgment or my memory, does he really love me? No; for I can lose these qualities without ceasing to be.",
    "Earnestness is enthusiasm tempered by reason.",
    "If we must not act save on a certainty, we ought not to act on religion, for it is not certain. But how many things we do on an uncertainty, sea voyages, battles!",
    "Since we cannot know all that there is to be known about anything, we ought to know a little about everything.",
    "The best defense against logic is ignorance.",
    "What a strange vanity painting is; it attracts admiration by resembling the original, we do not admire.",
    "If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since, having, neither parts nor limits, He has no affinity to us. We are then incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is. [So] you must wager. Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager then without hesitation that he is.",
    "Our achievements of today are but the sum total of our thoughts of yesterday.",
    "It is the heart which perceives God and not the reason.",
    "Being unable to cure death, wretchedness, and ignorance, men have decided, in order to be happy, not to think about such things.",
    "Nothing is surer than that the people will be weak.",
    "One must know oneself. If this does not serve to discover truth, it at least serves as a rule of life and there is nothing better.",
    "Let it not be imagined that the life of a good Christian must be a life of melancholy and gloominess; for he only resigns some pleasures to enjoy others infinitely better.",
    "When we see a natural style, we are astonished and charmed; for we expected to see an author, and we find a person.",
    "Unable to make what is just strong, we have made what is strong just.",
    "Man is neither angel nor beast.",
    "It is certain that the soul is either mortal or immortal. The decision of this question must make a total difference in the principles of morals. Yet philosophers have arranged their moral system entirely independent of this. What an extraordinary blindness!",
    "Instinct teaches us to look for happiness outside ourselves.",
    "He who does not know his way to the sea should take a river for his guide.",
    "Il n'y a que deux sortes d'hommes: les uns justes, qui se croient pe  cheurs; les autres pe  cheurs, qui se croient justes. There are only two types of people: the virtuous who believe themselves to be sinners and the sinners who believe themselves to be virtuous.",
    "We run heedlessly into the abyss after putting something in front of us to stop us from seeing it.",
    "God has given us evidence sufficiently clear to convince those with an open heart and mind.",

    "Excuse me, pray.\" Without that excuse I would not have known there was anything amiss.",
    "There is nothing so insupportable to man as to be in entire repose, without passion, occupation, amusement, or application. Then it is that he feels his own nothingness, isolation, insignificance, dependent nature, powerless, emptiness. Immediately there issue from his soul ennui, sadness, chagrin, vexation, despair.",
    "There are plenty of maxims in the world; all that remains is to apply them.",
    "What amazes me most is to see that everyone is not amazed at his own weakness.",

    "Man's grandeur is that he knows himself to be miserable.",
    "He who cannot believe is cursed, for he reveals by his unbelief that God has not chosen to give him grace.",
    "It is dangerous to tell the people that the laws are unjust; for they obey them only because they think them just. Therefore it isnecessary to tell them at the same time that they must obey them because they are laws, just as they must obey superiors, not because they are just, but because they are superiors. In this way all sedition is prevented.",
    "How shall one who is so weak in his childhood become really strong when he grows older? We only change our fancies.",
    "To deny, to believe, and to doubt well, are to a man what the race is to a horse.",
    "Our senses perceive no extreme. Too much sound deafens us; too much light dazzles us; too great distance or proximity hinders ourview. Too great length and too great brevity of discourse tends to obscurity; too much truth is paralyzing.... In short, extremes are for us as though they were not, and we are not within their notice. They escape us, or we them.",
    "The stream is always purer at its source.",
    "Reason is the slow and torturous method by which those who do not know the truth discover it",
    "To doubt is a misfortune, but to seek when in doubt is an indispensable duty. So he who doubts and seeks not is at once unfortunate and unfair.",

    "Those who are clever in imagination are far more pleased with themselves than prudent men could reasonably be.",
    "There are two types of mind . . . the mathematical, and what might be called the intuitive. The former arrives at its views slowly, but they are firm and rigid; the latter is endowed with greater flexibility and applies itself simultaneously to the diverse lovable parts of that which it loves.",
    "It is right that what is just should be obeyed.  It is necessary that what is strongest should be obeyed.",
    "Description of man: dependence, longing for independence, need.",
    "One must have deeper motives and judge everything accordingly, but go on talking like an ordinary person.",
    "To make a man a saint, it must indeed be by grace; and whoever doubts this does not know what a saint is, or a man.",
    "Man is so made that by continually telling him he is a fool he believes it, and by continually telling it to himself he makes himself believe it. For man holds an inward talk with himself, which it pays him to regulate.",
    "Whilst in speaking of human things, we say that it is necessary to know them before we love can them. The saints on the contrary say in speaking of divine things that it is necessary to love them in order to know them, and that we only enter truth through charity.",
    "To find recreation in amusements is not happiness; for this joy springs from alien and extrinsic sources, and is therefore dependent upon and subject to interruption by a thousand accidents, which may minister inevitable affliction.",
    "The majority is the best way, because it is visible, and has strength to make itself obeyed. Yet it is the opinion of the least able.",
    "The art of revolutionizing and overturning states is to undermine established customs, by going back to their origin, in order to mark their want of justice.",
    "Justice is what is established; and thus all our established laws will necessarily be regarded as just without examination, since they are established.",
    "There is no arena in which vanity displays itself under such a variety of forms as in conversation.",
    "It is not in Montaigne, but in myself, that I find all that I see in him.",
    "That queen, of error, whom we call fancy and opinion, is the more deceitful because she does not always deceive. She would be the infallible rule of truth if she were the infallible rule of falsehood; but being only most frequently in error, she gives no evidence of her real quality, for she marks with the same character both that which is true and that which is false.",
    "The law required what it could not give. Grace gives that which it requires.",
    "To go beyond the bounds of moderation is to outrage humanity.",
    "All great amusements are dangerous to the Christian life; but among all those which the world has invented there is none more to be feared than the theater. It is a representation of the passions so natural and so delicate that it excites them and gives birth to them in our hearts, and, above all, to that of love.",
    "Our nature consists in motion; complete rest is death.",
    "We are so presumptuous that we wish to be known to all the world, even to those who come after us; and we are so vain that the esteem of five or six persons immediately around us is enough to amuse and satisfy us.",

    "Vanity is so secure in the heart of man that everyone wants to be admired:  even I who write this, and you who read this.",
    "It is certain that those who have the living faith in their hearts see at once that all existence is none other than the work of the God whom they adore. But for those in whom this light is extinguished, [if we were to show them our proofs of the existence of God] nothing is more calculated to arouse their contempt. . . .",
    "Our own interests are still an exquisite means for dazzling our eyes agreeably.",
    "All our life passes in this way: we seek rest by struggling against certain obstacles, and once they are overcome, rest proves intolerable because of the boredom it produces.",
    "Who can doubt that we exist only to love? Disguise it, in fact, as we will, we love without intermission... We live not a moment exempt from its influence.",

    "Opinion is, as it were, the queen of the world, but force is its tyrant.",
    "The last proceeding of reason is to recognize that there is an infinity of things which are beyond it. There is nothing so conformable to reason as this disavowal of reason.",
    "Beauty is a harmonious relation between something in our nature and the quality of the object which delights us.",
    "The serene, silent beauty of a holy life is the most powerful influence in the world, next to the night of God.",
    "We know then the existence and nature of the finite, because we also are finite and have extension. We know the existence of the infinite and are ignorant of its nature, because it has extension like us, but not limits like us. But we know neither the existence nor the nature of God, because he has neither extension nor limits.",
    "When a soldier complains of his hard life (or a labourer, etc.) try giving him nothing to do.",

    "The statements of atheists ought to be perfectly clear of doubt. Now it is not perfectly clear that the soul is material.",
    "Few men speak humbly of humility, chastely of chastity, skeptically of skepticism.",
    "Anyone who found the secret of rejoicing when things go well without being annoyed when they go badly would have found the point.",
    "Let us, then, take our compass; we are something, and we are not everything. The nature of our existence hides from us the knowledge of first beginnings which are born of the nothing; and the littleness of our being conceals from us the sight of the infinite. Our intellect holds the same position in the world of thought as our body occupies in the expanse of nature.",
    "There is a certain standard of grace and beauty which consists in a certain relation between our nature, such as it is, weak or strong, and the thing which pleases us. Whatever is formed according to this standard pleases us, be it house, song, discourse, verse, prose, woman, birds, rivers, trees, room, dress, and so on. Whatever is not made according to this standard displeases those who have good taste.",
    "At the centre of every human being is a God-shaped vacuum which can only be filled by Jesus Christ.",
    "How I hate this folly of not believing in the Eucharist, etc.! If the gospel be true, if Jesus Christ be God, what difficulty is there?",
    "Imagination magnifies small objects with fantastic exaggeration until they fill our soul, and with bold insolence cuts down great things to its own size, as when speaking of God.",
    "There is a virtuous fear, which is the effect of faith; and there is a vicious fear, which is the product of doubt. The former leads to hope, as relying on God, in whom we believe; the latter inclines to despair, as not relying on God, in whom we do not believe. Persons of the one character fear to lose God; persons of the other character fear to find Him.",
    "Justice and power must be brought together, so that whatever is just may be powerful, and whatever is powerful may be just.",
    "When we are in love we seem to ourselves quite different from what we were before.",
    "One has followed the other in an endless circle, for it is certain that as man's insight increases so he finds both wretchedness and greatness within himself. In a word man knows he is wretched. Thus he is wretched because he is so, but he is truly great because he knows it.",
    "Nature is an infinite sphere of which the center is everywhere and the circumference nowhere.",
    "Our imagination so magnifies this present existence, by the power of continual reflection on it, and so attenuates eternity, by not thinking of it at all, that we reduce an eternity to nothingness, and expand a mere nothing to an eternity; and this habit is so inveterately rooted in us that all the force of reason cannot induce us to lay it aside.",
    "The world is satisfied with words. Few appreciate the things beneath.\n[Fr., Le monde se paye de paroles; peu approfondissement les choses.]",
    "The two principles of truth, reason and senses, are not only both not genuine, but are engaged in mutual deception. The senses deceive reason through false appearances, and the senses are disturbed by passions, which produce false impressions.",
    "If we do not know ourselves to be full of pride, ambition, lust, weakness, misery, and injustice, we are indeed blind. And if, knowing this, we do not desire deliverance, what can we say of a man...?",
    "To speak freely of mathematics, I find it the highest exercise of the spirit; but at the same time I know that it is so useless that I make little distinction between a man who is only a mathematician and a common artisan. Also, I call it the most beautiful profession in the world; but it is only a profession.",
    "Il y a deux sortes d'esprits, l'un ge  ome  trique, et l'autre que l'on peut appeler de finesse. Le premier a des vues lentes, dures et inflexibles; mais le dernier a une souplesse de pense  e. There are two kinds of mind, one mathematical, the other what one might call the intuitive. The first takes a slow, firm, inflexible view, but the latter has flexibility of thought.",
    "The world is satisfied with words, few care to dive beneath the surface.",
    "This is what I see, and what troubles me. I look on all sides, and everywhere I see nothing but obscurity. Nature offers me nothing that is not a matter of doubt and disquiet.",
    "All men are almost led to believe not of proof, but by attraction. This way is base, ignoble, and irrelevant; every one therefore disavows it. Each one professes to believe and even to love\nnothing but what he knows to be worthy of belief and love.",
    "We are fools to depend upon the society of our fellow-men. Wretched as we are, powerless as we are, they will not aid us; we shall die alone.",
    "The parts of the universe ... all are connected with each other in such a way that I think it to be impossible to understand any one without the whole.",
    "The consciousness of the falsity of present pleasures, and the ignorance of the vanity of absent pleasures, cause inconstancy.",
    "No soul of high estate can take pleasure in slander. It betrays a weakness.",
    "As men are not able to fight against death, misery, ignorance, they have taken it into their heads, in order to be happy, not to think of them at all.",
    "The Church limits her sacramental services to the faithful. Christ gave Himself upon the cross a ransom for all.",
    "We sail within a vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end.",

    "The sole cause of man's unhappiness is that he does not know how to stay quietly in his room.",
    "Eloquence is a painting of the thoughts.",
    "It is good to be tired and wearied by the futile search after the true good, that we may stretch out our arms to the Redeemer.",
    "Men are so necessarily mad, that not to be mad would amount to another form of madness.",
    "The pagans do not know God, and love only the earth. The Jews know the true God, and love only the earth. The Christians know the true God, and do not love the earth.",
    "[Christianity] endeavors equally to establish these two things: that God has set up in the Church visible signs to make himself known to those who should seek him sincerely, and that he has nevertheless so disguised them that he will only be perceived by those who seek him with all their heart.",
    "True eloquence makes light of eloquence.  True morality makes light of morality.",
    "The heart has its reasons, which Reason does not know. We feel it in a thousand things. It is the heart which feels God, and not Reason. This, then, is perfect faith: God felt in the heart.",
    "How hollow is the heart of man, and how full of excrement!",
    "A mere trifle consoles us, for a mere trifle distresses us.",
    "Christianity is strange. It bids man recognise that he is vile, even abominable, and bids him desire to be like God. Without such a counterpoise, this dignity would make him horribly vain, or this humiliation would make him terribly abject.",
    "Nothing fortifies scepticism more than that there are some who are not sceptics; if all were so, they would be wrong.",
    "We are so presumptuous that we should like to be known all over the world, even by people who will only come when we are no more. Such is our vanity that the good opinion of half a dozen of the people around us gives us pleasure and satisfaction.",
    "Each man is everything to himself, for with his death everything is dead for him. That is why each of us thinks he is everything to everyone. We must not judge nature by ourselves, but by its own standards.",
    "The finite is annihilated in the presence of the infinite, and becomes a pure nothing. So our spirit before God, so our justice before divine justice.",
    "It is a dangerous experiment to call in gratitude as an ally to love. Love is a debt which inclination always pays, obligation never.",
    "We sail within a vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end. When we think to attach ourselves to any pointand to fasten to it, it wavers and leaves us; and if we follow it, it eludes our grasp, slips past us, and vanishes for ever. Nothing stays for us.",
    "Atheism shows strength of mind, but only to a certain degree.",
    "We like to be deceived.",
    "Man is clearly made to think. It is his whole dignity and his whole merit; and his whole duty is to think as he ought. And the order of thought is to begin with ourselves, and with our Author and our end.",
    "All men naturally hate one another. I hold it a fact, that if men knew exactly what one says of the other, there would not be four friends in the world.",
    "The eternal Being is forever if he is at all.",
    "Perfect clarity would profit the intellect but damage the will.",
    "We know the truth not only through our reason but also through our heart. It is through the latter that we know first principles, and reason, which has nothing to do with it, tries in vain to refute them.",
    "If a soldier or labourer complain of the hardship of his lot, set him to do nothing.",
    "Man is so made that if he is told often enough that he is a fool he believes it.",
    "Man is only a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed. There is no need for the whole universe to take up arms to crush him: a vapour, a drop of water is enough to kill him. but even if the universe were to crush him, man would still be nobler than his slayer, because he knows that he is dying and the advantage the universe has over him. The universe knows none of this.",
    "All of our miseries prove our greatness. They are the miseries of a dethroned monarch.",
    "It is the contest that delights us, and not the victory.",
    "Reason's last step is to acknowledge that there are infinitely many things\nbeyond it.",
    "If they [Plato and Aristotle] wrote about politics it was as if to lay down rules for a madhouse. And if they pretended to treat it as something really important it was because they knew that the madmen they were talking to believed themselves to be kings and emperors. They humored these beliefs in order to calm down their madness with as little harm as possible.",
    "Those we call the ancients were really new in everything.",
    "Great and small suffer the same mishaps.",
    "When some passion or effect is described in a natural style, we find within ourselves the truth of what we hear, without knowing it was there.",
    "If he exalts himself, I humble him. If he humbles himself, I exalt him. And I go on contradicting him Until he understands That he is a monster that passes all understanding.",
    "There should be in eloquence that which is pleasing and that which is real; but that which is pleasing should itself be real.",
    "As we speak of poetical beauty, so ought we to speak of mathematical beauty and medical beauty. But we do not do so; and that reason is that we know well what is the object of mathematics, and that it consists in proofs, and what is the object of medicine, and that it consists in healing. But we do not know in what grace consists, which is the object of poetry.",
    "Faith indeed tells what the senses do not tell, but not the contrary of what they see. It is above them and not contrary to them.",
    "Vanity of science. Knowledge of physical science will not console me for ignorance of morality in time of affliction, but knowledge of morality will always console me for ignorance of physical science.",
    "Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them; no art can keep or acquire them.",
    "Let each of us examine his thoughts",
    "We have so exalted a notion of the human soul that we cannot bear to be despised, or even not to be esteemed by it. Man, in fact, places all his happiness in this esteem.",
    "The heart has its order, the mind has its own, which uses principles and demonstrations. The heart has a different one. We do not prove that we ought to be loved by setting out in order the causes of love; that would be absurd.",
    "Nothing is thoroughly approved but mediocrity. The majority has established this, and it fixes its fangs on whatever gets beyond it either way.",
    "A little thing comforts us because a little thing afflicts us.",
    "It is not from space that I must seek my dignity, but from the government of my thought. I shall have no more if I possess worlds. By space the universe encompasses and swallows me up like an atom; by thought I comprehend the world.",
    "Vanity is so anchored in the heart of man that a soldier, a soldier's servant, a cook, a porter brags and wishes to have his admirers. Even philosophers wish for them. Those who write against vanity want to have the glory of having written well; and those who read it desire the glory of having read it. I who write this have perhaps this desire, and perhaps those who will read it.",
    "The war existing between the senses and reason.",
    "Sneezing absorbs all the functions of the soul just as much as the [sexual] act, but we do not draw from it the same conclusions against the greatness of man, because it is involuntary; although we bring it about, we do so involuntarily. It is not for the sake of the thing in itself but for another end, and is therefore not a sign of man's weakness, or his subjection to this act.",
    "Pride counterbalances all our miseries, for it either hides them, or, if it discloses them, boasts of that disclosure. Pride has such a thorough possession of us, even in the midst of our miseries and faults, that we are prepared to sacrifice life with joy, if it may but be talked of.",
    "The last advance of reason is to recognize that it is surpassed by innumerable things; it is feeble if it cannot realize that.",
    "If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation, that He exists.",
    "Let no one say that I have said nothing new... the arrangement of the subject is new. When we play tennis, we both play with the same ball, but one of us places it better.",

    "It is not good to be too free. It is not good to have all one wants.",
    "The last thing we decide in writing a book is what to put first.",
    "To ridicule philosophy is truly philosophical.\n[Fr., Se moquer de la philosophie c'est vraiment philosophe.]",
    "Man is so great that his greatness appears even in the consciousness of his misery. A tree does not know itself to be miserable. It is true that it is misery indeed to know one's self to be miserable; but then it is greatness also. In this way, all man's miseries go to prove his greatness. They are the miseries of a mighty potentate, of a dethroned monarch.",
    "There is a lot of difference between tempting and leading into error. God tempts but does not lead into error. To tempt is to provide opportunities for us to do certain things if we do not love God, but putting us under no necessity to do so. To lead into error is to compel a man necessarily to conclude and follow a falsehood.",
    "The God of the infinite is the God of the infinitesimal.",
    "The mind must not be forced; artificial and constrained manners fill it with foolish presumption, through unnatural elevation and vain and ridiculous inflation, instead of solid and\nvigorous nutriment.",
    "When we read too fast or too slowly, we understand nothing.",
    "Men blaspheme what they do not know.",
    "God is, or He is not.\" But to which side shall we incline? Reason can decide nothing here. There is an infinite chaos which separated us. A game is being played at the extremity of this infinite distance where heads or tails will turn up. What will you wager?",

    "Continuous eloquence is tedious.",
    "When we see an effect happen always in the same manner, we infer that it takes place by a natural necessity; as, for instance, that the sun will rise to morrow; but nature often deceives us, and will not submit to its own rules.",

    "The truth about nature we discover with our brains. The truth about religion we discover with our hearts.",
    "I have spent much time in the study of the abstract sciences; but the paucity of persons with whom you can communicate on such subjects disgusted me with them. When I began to study man, I saw that these abstract sciences are not suited to him, and that in diving into them, I wandered farther from my real object than those who knew them not, and I forgave them for not having attended to these things. I expected then, however, that I should find some companions in the study of man, since it was so specifically a duty. I was in error. There are fewer students of man than of geometry.",

    "Any unity which doesn't have its origin in the multitudes is tyranny.",

    "Discourses on humility are a source of pride in the vain and of humility in the humble.",
    "Man is nothing but insincerity, falsehood, and hypocrisy, both in regard to himself and in regard to others. He does not wish that he should be told the truth, he shuns saying it to others; and all these moods, so inconsistent with justice and reason, have their roots in his heart.",
    "Look for the truth, it wants to be found.",
    "There was once in man a true happiness of which there now remain to him only the mark and empty trace, which he in vain tries to fill from all his surroundings, seeking from things absent the help he does not obtain in things present.",

    "Things are always at their best in their beginning.",

    "Since we cannot be universal and know all that is to be known of everything, we ought to know a little about everything. For it is far better to know something about everything than to know all about one thing. This universality is the best. If we can have both, still better; but if we must choose, we ought to choose the former.",

Voila le commencement et l'image de l'usurpation de toute la terre.]",
    "When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, one feels within oneself the truth of what one reads, which was there before, although one did not know it. Hence one is inclined to love him who makes us feel it, for he has not shown us his own riches, but ours. ...such community of intellect that we have with him necessarily inclines the heart to love.",

    "The mind of the greatest man on earth is not so independent of circumstances as not to feel inconvenienced by the merest buzzing noise about him; it does not need the report of a cannon to disturb his thoughts. The creaking of a vane or a pully is quite enough. Do not wonder that he reasons ill just now; a fly is buzzing by his ear; it is quite enough to unfit him for giving good counsel.",

    "When we do not know the truth of a thing, it is good that there should exist a common error which determines the mind of man, as, for example, the moon, to which is attributed the change of seasons, the progress of diseases, etc. For the chief malady of man is a restless curiosity about things which he cannot understand; and it is not so bad for him to be in error as to be curious to no purpose.",
    "Each one is all in all to himself; for being dead, all is dead to him.",
    "The only thing which consoles for our miseries is diversion, and yet this is the greatest of our miseries. For it is this which principally hinders us from reflecting upon ourselves and which makes us imperceptibly ruin ourselves.",
    "Symmetry is what we see at a glance; based on the fact that there is no reason for any difference.",
    "Without [diversion] we would be in a state of weariness, and this weariness would spur us on to seek a more solid means of escaping from it. But diversion amuses us, and leads us unconsciously to death.",
    "Thinking too little about things or thinking too much both make us obstinate and fanatical.",
    "Extremes are for us as though they were not, and we are not within their notice. They escape us, or we them. This is our true state; this is what makes us incapable of certain knowledge and of absolute ignorance... This is our natural condition, and yet most contrary to our inclination; we burn with desire to find solid ground and an ultimate sure foundation whereon to build a tower reaching to the Infinite.

    "Nothing is so conformable to reason as to disavow reason.",
    "Brave deeds are wasted when hidden.",
    "May God never abandon me.",
    "We make an idol of truth itself; for truth apart from charity is not God, but His image and idol, which we must neither love nor worship.",
    "Rivers are roads that move and carry us whither we wish to go.\n[Fr., Les rivieres sont des chemins qui marchant et qui portent ou l'on veut aller.]",
    "Do they think that they have given us great pleasure by telling us that they hold our soul to be no more than wind or smoke, and saying it moreover in tones of pride and satisfaction? Is this then something to be said gaily? Is it not on the contrary something to be said sadly, as being the saddest thing in the world?",
    "We must know where to doubt, where to feel certain, where to submit. He who does not do so, understands not the force of reason.",
    "I would inquire of reasonable persons whether this principle: Matter is naturally wholly incapable of thought, and this other: I think, therefore I am, are in fact the same in the mind of\nDescartes, and in that of St. Augustine, who said the same thing twelve hundred years before.",
    "There are three means of believing--by inspiration, by reason, and by custom. Christianity, which is the only rational institution, does yet admit none for its sons who do not believe by inspiration. Nor does it injure reason or custom, or debar them of their proper force; on the contrary, it directs us to open our minds by the proofs of the former, and to confirm our minds by the authority of the latter.",
    "In order to enter into a real knowledge of your condition, consider it in this image: A man was cast by a tempest upon an unknown island, the inhabitants of which were in trouble to find\ntheir king, who was lost; and having a strong resemblance both in form and face to this king, he was taken for him, and acknowledged in this capacity by all the people.",
    "Habit is a second nature that destroys the first. But what is nature? Why is habit not natural? I am very much afraid that nature itself is only a first habit, just as habit is a second nature.",
    "What a chimera then is man. What a novelty! What a monster... what a contradiction, what a prodigy",
    "It is of dangerous consequence to represent to man how near he is to the level of beasts, without showing him at the same time his greatness. It is likewise dangerous to let him see his greatness without his meanness. It is more dangerous yet to leave him ignorant of either; but very beneficial that he should be made sensible of both.",
    "Nobody is publicly accepted as an expert on poetry unless he displays the sign of poet, mathematician, etc., but universal men want no sign and make hardly any distinction between the crafts of poet and embroiderer. Universal men are not called poets or mathematicians, etc. But they are all these things and judges of them too. No one could guess what they are, and they will talk about whatever was being talked about when they came in. One quality is not more noticeable in them than another, unless it becomes necessary to put it into practice, and then we remember it.",
    "The philosophers talk to you about the dignity of man, and they tempt you to pride, or they talk to you about the misery of man, and they tempt you to despair.",
    "Fuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy, \nsuch as solar- and wind-derived electricity,. envisioned an age of \"universal education and sustenance of all humanity\".\n\"The heart has reasons that reason does not understand.\"",
    "Put the world's greatest philosopher on a plank that is wider than need be; if there is a precipe below, although his reason may convince him that he is safe, his imagination will prevail.",
    "All who say the same things do not possess them in the same manner; and hence the incomparable author of the Art of Conversation pauses with so much care to make it understood that we must not judge of the capacity of a man by the excellence of a happy remark that we heard him make. Let us penetrate, says he, the mind from which it proceeds. It will oftenest be seen that he will be made to disavow it on the spot, and will be drawn very far from this better thought in which he does not believe, to plunge himself into another, quite base and ridiculous.",
    "There are hardly any truths upon which we always remain agreed, and still fewer objects of pleasure which we do not change every hour, I do not know whether there is a means of giving fixed\nrules for adapting discourse to the inconstancy of our caprices.",
    "Contradiction is not a sign of falsity, nor the lack of contradiction a sign of truth.",
    "People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come in to the mind of others.",
    "What is it, in your opinion, to be a great nobleman? It is to be master of several objects that men covet, and thus to be able to satisfy the wants and the desires of many. It is these\nwants and these desires that attract them towards you, and that make them submit to you: were it not for these, they would not even look at you; but they hope, by these services... to obtain\nfrom you some part of the good which they desire, and of which they see that you have the disposal.",
    "You are in the same manner surrounded with a small circle of persons... full of desire. They demand of you the benefits of desire... You are therefore properly the king of desire. ...equal\nin this to the greatest kings of the earth... It is desire that constitutes their power; that is, the possession of things that men covet.",
    "The method of not erring is sought by all the world. The logicians profess to guide it, the geometricians alone attain it, and apart from science, and the imitations of it, there are no\ntrue demonstrations.",
    "The arithmetical machine produces effects that approach nearer to thought than all the actions of animals. But it does nothing that would enable us to attribute will to it, as to the animals.",
    "Those who write against vanity want the glory of having written well, and their readers the glory of reading well, and I who write this have the same desire, as perhaps those who read this have also.",
    "If man were happy, he would be the more so, the less he was diverted, like the saints and God.",
    "The last act is bloody, however pleasant all the rest of the play is: a little earth is thrown at last upon our head, and that is the end forever.",
    "If you believe in God you are at no disadvantage in this life, and at considerable advantage in the next. If you do not believe, but find in the next that there was a next, you are most unfortunate!",
    "Quelque e  tendue d'esprit que l'on ait, l'on n'est capable que d'une grande passion. However vast a man's spirit, he is only capable of one great passion.",
    "Le silence e  ternel de ces espaces infinis m'effraie. The eternal silence of these infinite spaces fills me with dread.",
    "Man's greatness is great in that he knows himself wretched. A tree does not know itself wretched. It is then being wretched to know oneself wretched; but it is being great to know that one is wretched.",
    "We do not rest satisfied with the present.... So imprudent we are that we wander in the times which are not ours and do not thinkof the only one which belongs to us; and so idle are we that we dream of those times which are no more and thoughtlessly overlook that which alone exists. For the present is generally painful to us.",
    "According to the doctrine of chance, you ought to put yourself to the trouble of searching for the truth; for if you die without worshiping the True Cause, you are lost. \"But,\" say you, \"if He had wished me to worship Him, He would have left me signs of His will.\" He has done so; but you neglect them. Seek them, therefore; it is well worth it.",
    "Those great efforts of intellect, upon which the mind sometimes touches, are such that it cannot maintain itself there. It only leaps to them, not as upon a throne, forever, but merely for an instant.",
    "Caesar was too old, it seems to me, to go off and amuse himself conquering the world. Such a pastime was all right for Augustus and Alexander; they were young men, not easily held in check, but Caesar ought to have been more mature.",
    "True eloquence makes light of eloquence, true morality makes light of morality; that is to say, the morality of the judgment, which has no rules, makes light of the morality of the intellect.... To make light of philosophy is to be a true philosopher.",
    "Nothing is more dastardly than to act with bravado toward God.",
    "Since [man] is infinitely removed from comprehending the extremes, the end of things and their beginning are hopelessly hidden from him in an impenetrable secret; he is equally incapable of seeing the nothing from which he was made, and the infinite in which he is swallowed up.",
    "Let man then contemplate nature in full and lofty majesty, and turn his eyes away from the mean objects which surround him. Let him look at the dazzling light hung aloft as an eternal lamp to lighten the universe; let him behold the earth, a mere dot compared with the vast circuit which that orb describes, and stand amazed to find that the vast circuit itself is but a very fine point compared with the orbit traced by the starts as they roll their course on high.",
    "What matters it that man should have a little more knowledge of the universe? If he has it, he gets little higher. Is he not always infinitely removed from the end, and is not the duration of our life equally removed from eternity, even if it lasts ten years longer?",
    "Knowledge has two extremes. The first is the pure natural ignorance in which all men find themselves at birth. The other extreme is that reached by great minds, who, having run through all that men can know, find they know nothing, and come back again to that same natural ignorance from which they set out; this is a learned ignorance which is conscious of itself.",
    "The sum of a man's problems come from his inability to be alone in a silent room.",

    "All this visible world is but an imperceptible point in the ample bosom of nature.",
    "I take it as a matter not to be disputed, that if all knew what each said of the other, there would not be four friends in the world. This seems proved by the quarrels and disputes caused by the disclosures which are occasionally made.",
    "When malice has reason on its side, it looks forth bravely, and displays that reason in all its luster. When austerity and self-denial have not realized true happiness, and the soul returns to the dictates of nature, the reaction is fearfully extravagant.",
    "Admiration spoils all from infancy.",
    "I cannot judge my work while I am doing it. I have to do as painters do, stand back and view it from a distance, but not too great a distance. How great? Guess.",

    "I should not be a Christian but for the miracles.",
    "Do you wish people to speak well of you? Then do not speak at all yourself.",
    "Man is full of desires: he loves only those who can satisfy them all. \"This man is a good mathematician,\" someone will say. But I have no concern for mathematics; he would take me for a proposition. \"That one is a good soldier.\" He would take me for a besieged town. I need, that is to say, a decent man who can accommodate himself to all my desires in a general sort of way.",
    "Without the knowledge of our wretchedness, the knowledge of God creates pride. With it, the knowledge of God creates despair. The knowledge of Christ offers a third way, because in him we find both God and our wretchedness.",
    "Vanity is illustrated in the cause and effect of love, as in the case of Cleopatra.",
    "For as old age is that period of life most remote from infancy, who does not see that old age in this universal man ought not to be sought in the times nearest his birth, but in those most\n remote from it?",
    "Let us now speak according to natural lights. If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible. . . . We are then incapable of knowing of either what He is or if He is. . . .",
    "La dernie'  re chose qu'on trouve en faisant un ouvrage, est de savoir celle qu'il faut mettre la premie'  re. The last thing one discovers in composing a work iswhat to put first.",
    "What a chimaera then is man, what a novelty, what a monster, what chaos, what a subject of contradiction, what a prodigy! Judge of all things, yet an imbecile earthworm; depository of truth, yet a sewer of uncertainty and error; pride and refuse of the universe. Who shall resolve this tangle?",
    "If we submit everything to reason our religion will be left with nothing mysterious or supernatural. If we offend the principles of reason our religion will be absurd and ridiculous . . . There are two equally dangerous extremes: to exclude reason, to admit nothing but reason.",
    "Just as I do not know where I came from, so I do not know where I am going. All I know is that when I leave this world I shall fall forever into oblivion, or into the hands of an angry God, without knowing which of the two will be my lot for eternity. Such is my state of mind, full of weakness and uncertainty. The only conclusion I can draw from all this is that I must pass my days without a thought of trying to find out what is going to happen to me.",

    "Eloquence; it requires the pleasant and the real; but the pleasant must itself be drawn from the true.",
    "Those who are accustomed to judge by feeling do not understand the process of reasoning, because they want to comprehend at a glance and are not used to seeking for first principles. Those, on the other hand, who are accustomed to reason from first principles do not understand matters of feeling at all, because they look for first principles and are unable to comprehend at a glance.",
    "How vain painting is-we admire the realistic depiction of objects which in their original state we don't admire at all.",
    "When a man who accepts the Christian doctrine lives unworthily of it, it is much clearer to say he is a bad Christian than to say he is not a Christian.",
    "The Stoics say, \"Retire within yourselves; it is there you will find your rest.\" And that is not true. Others say, \"Go out of yourselves; seek happiness in amusement.\" And this is not true. Illness comes. Happiness is neither without us nor within us. It is in God, both without us and within us.",

    "It is an appalling thing to feel all one possesses drain away.",
    "All the dignity of man consists in thought. Thought is therefore by its nature a wonderful and incomparable thing. It must have strange defects to be contemptible. But it has such, so that nothing is more ridiculous. How great it is in its nature! How vile it is in its defects! But what is this thought? How foolish it is!",
    "When I consider the small span of my life absorbed in the eternity of all time, or the small part of space which I can touch or see engulfed by the infinite immensity of spaces that I know not and that know me not, I am frightened and astonished to see myself here instead of there … now instead of then.",
