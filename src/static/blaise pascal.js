    "All media exist to invest our lives with artificial perceptions and arbitrary values.",
    "All media work us over completely. They are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered. The medium is the message. Any understanding of social and cultural change is impossible without a knowledge of the way media work as environments. All media are extensions of some human faculty - psychic or physical.",
    "We become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us.",
    "Politics will eventually be replaced by imagery. The politician will be only too happy to abdicate in favor of his image, because the image will be so much more powerful than he could ever be.",
    "People hope that if they scream loudly enough about \"values\" then others will mistake them for serious, sensitive souls who have higher and nobler perceptions than ordinary people. Otherwise, why would they be screaming? Moral bitterness is a basic technique for endowing the idiot with dignity.",

    "Anyone who tries to make a distinction between education and entertainment doesn't know the first thing about either.",
    "Societies have always been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the content of the communication.",
    "Once we have surrendered our senses and nervous systems to the private manipulation of those who would try to benefit from taking a lease on our eyes and ears and nerves, we don't really have any rights left. Leasing our eyes and ears and nerves to commercial interests is like handing over the common speech to a private corporation, or like giving the earth's atmosphere to a company as a monopoly.",
    "A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding.",
    "One of the effects of living with electric information is that we live habitually in a state of information overload. There's always more than you can cope with.",
    "The tribalizing power of the new electronic media, the way in which they return to us to the unified fields of the old oral cultures, to tribal cohesion and pre-individualist patterns of thought, is little understood. Tribalism is the sense of the deep bond of family, the closed society as the norm of community.",
    "I wouldn't have seen it if I hadn't believed it.",
    "The more the data banks record about each one of us, the less we exist.",
    "Like primitive, we now live in a global village of our own making, a simultaneous happening. It doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs.",

    "I don't necessarily agree with everything I say.",
    "Everybody experiences far more than he understands. Yet it is experience, rather than understanding, that influences behavior.",
    "Computers can do better than ever what needn't be done at all. Making sense is still a human monopoly.",

    "In television, images are projected at you. You are the screen. The images wrap around you. You are the vanishing point.",

    "The new is always made up of the old, or rather, what people see in the new is always the old thing. The rear-view mirror. The future of the future is the present, and this is something that people are terrified of.",
    "Timeâ€™ has ceased, 'space' has vanished. We now live in a global village... a simultaneous happening",
    "\"Work\" does not exist in a nonliterate world. The primitive hunter or fisherman did no work, any more than does the poet, painter, or thinker of today. Where the whole man is involved there is no work.",
    "Our Age of Anxiety is, in great part, the result of trying to do today's job with yesterday's tools and yesterday's concepts.",
    "Violence is the quest for identity. When identity disappears with technological innovation, violence is the natural recourse.",
    "The ordinary person senses the greatness of the odds against him even without thought or analysis, and he adapts his attitudes unconsciously. A huge passivity has settled on industrial society. For people carried about in mechanical vehicles, earning their living by waiting on machines, listening much of the waking day to canned music, watching packaged movie entertainment and capsulated news, for such people it would require an exceptional degree of awareness and an especial heroism of effort to be anything but supine consumers of processed goods.",
    "When information overload occurs, pattern recognition is how to determine truth.",
    "Affluence creates poverty.",
    "The most human thing about us is our technology.",
    "The poet, the artist, the sleuth, whoever sharpens our perception tends to antisocial; rarely 'well adjusted,' he cannot go along with currents and trends.",
    "the only people who have proof of their sanity are those who have been discharged from mental institutions",
    "The business of art is no longer the communication of thoughts or feelings which are to be conceptually ordered, but a direct participation in an experience. The whole tendency of modern communication...is towards participation in a process, rather than apprehension of concepts.",
    "The medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium - that is, of any extension of ourselves - result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves, or by any new technology.",

    "I may be wrong, but I'm never in doubt.",
    "Any breakdown is a breakthrough.",
    "With the arrival of electric technology, man extended, or set outside himself, a live model of the central nervous system itself. To the degree that this is so, it is a development that suggests a desperate and suicidal autoamputation, as if the central nervous system could no longer depend on the physical organs to be protective buffers against the slings and arrows of outrageous mechanism.",
    "An administrator in a bureaucratic world is a man who can feel big by merging his non-entity in an abstraction. A real person in touch with real things inspires terror in him.",

    "There ain't no grammatical errors in a non-literate society.",
    "I am resolutely opposed to all innovation, all change, but I am determined to understand whatâ€™s happening. Because I donâ€™t choose just to sit and let the juggernaut roll over me. Many people seem to think that if you talk about something recent, youâ€™re in favor of it. The exact opposite is true in my case. Anything I talk about is almost certainly something Iâ€™m resolutely against. And it seems to me the best way to oppose it is to understand it. And then you know where to turn off the buttons.",

    "Publication is a self-invasion of privacy.",
    "The price of eternal vigilance is indifference.",
    "When people become too intense, too serious, they will have trouble in relating to any sort of social game or norm. Perhaps this is why jokes are so important. On one hand they tell us about where the problems and grievances are, and, at the same time, they provide the means of enduring these grievances by laughing at the problems.",
    "Attention spans get very weak at the speed of light, and that goes along with a very weak identity.",
    "The young today cannot follow narrative but they are alert to drama. They cannot bear description but they love landscape and action.",
    "If men were able to be convinced that art is a precise advance knowledge of how to cope with the psychic and social consequences of the next technology, would they all become artist? Or would they begin a careful translation of new art forms into social navigation charts? I am curious to know what would happem if art were suddenly seen for what it is, namely, exact information of how to rearrange one's psyche in order to anticipate the next blow from our own extended faculties.",
    "The greatest propaganda in the world is our mother tongue, that is what we learn as children, and which we learn unconsciously. That shapes our perceptions for life. That is propaganda at its most extreme form.",
    "It has always been the artist who realizes that the future is the present and uses his work to prepare the grounds for it",
    "People don't actually read newspapers - they get into them every morning like a hot bath.",
    "Advertising is the greatest art form of the 20th century.",
    "Physiologically, man in the normal use of technology (or his variously extended body) is perpetually modified by it and in turn finds ever new ways of modifying his technology. Man becomes, as it were, the sex organs of the machine world, as the bee of the plant world, enabling it to fecundate and to evolve ever new forms. The machine world reciprocates man's love by expediting his wishes and desires, namely, in providing him with wealth.",
    "The percept takes priority of the concept.",
    "Poetry and the arts canâ€™t exist in America. Mere exposure to the arts does nothing for a mentality which is incorrigibly dialectical. The vital tensions and nutritive action of ideogram\n remain inaccessible to this state of mind.",
    "First we build the tools, then they build us.",
    "The electric age ... established a global network that has much the character of our central nervous system.",
    "Those conspiracies that are too incredible to be believed, are by the same right, those which most often succeed.",
    "Anything that's popular is a rear-view image.",
    "Professionalism merges the individual into patterns of total environment. Amateurism seeks the development of the total awareness of the individual and the critical awareness of the groundrules of society. The amateur can afford to lose. The professional tends to classify and specialise, to accept uncritically the groundrules of the environment. The groundrules provided by the mass response of his colleagues serve as a pervasive environment of which he is contentedly unaware. The 'expert' is the man who stays put.",
    "Mass man is a phenomenon of electric speed, not of physical quantity.",
    "Our permanent address is tommorrow.",
    "During the Second War, the U.S.O. sent special issues of the principal American magazines to the Armed Forces, with the ads omitted. The men insisted on having the ads back again. Naturally. The ads are by far the best part of any magazine or newspaper. More pains and thought, more wit and art go into the making of an ad than into any prose feature of press or magazine. Ads are news. What is wrong with them is that they are always good news.",
    "It is one of the peculiar characteristics of the photograph that it isolates single moments in time.",
    "If we understand the revolutionary transformations caused by new media, we can anticipate and control them; but if we continue in our self-induced subliminal trance, we will be their slaves.",
    "Language is a form of organized stutter.",

    "Today's child is bewildered when he enters the 19th century environment that still characterizes the educational establishment where information is scarce but ordered and structured by fragmented, classified patterns subjects, and schedules.",
    "Ads represent the main channel of intellectual and artistic effort in the modern world.",
    "All forms of violence are quests for identity. When you live on the frontier, you have no identity. You're a nobody.",
    "The artist is the person who invents the means to bridge between biological inheritance and the environments created by technological innovation.",
    "I expect to see the coming decades transform the planet into an art form; the new man, linked in a cosmic harmony that transcends time and space, will sensuously caress and mold and pattern every facet of the terrestrial artifact as if it were a work of art, and man himself will become an organic art form.",
    "Some of my fellow academics are very hostile, but I sympathize with them. They've been asleep for 500 years and they don't like anybody who comes along and stirs them up.",
    "Mass transportation is doomed to failure in North America because a person's car is the only place where he can be alone and think.",
    "The village had institutionalized all human functions in forms of low intensity.... Participation was high and organization was low. This is the formula for stability.",
    "Mysticism is just tomorrow's science dreamed today.",
    "I am a Christian according to my conscience in belief,in purpose and wish;Mnot of course by the orthodox standard. But I am content, and have a feeling of trust and safety.\nThe Machiavellian mind and the merchant mind are at one in their simple faith in the power of segmental division to rule all--in the dichotomy of power and morals and of money and morals.",
    "The car has become the carapace, the protective and aggressive shell, of urban and suburban man.",
    "To say that \"the camera cannot lie\" is merely to underline the multiple deceits that are now practised in its name.",
    "As the unity of the modern world becomes increasingly a technological rather than a social affair, the techniques of the arts provide the most valuable means of insight into the real direction of our own collective purposes.",
    "Ideally, advertising aims at the goal of a programmed harmony among all human impulses and aspirations and endeavors. Using handicraft methods, it stretches out toward the ultimate electronic goal of a collective consciousness.",
    "People who write obscurely are either unskilled in writing or up to mischief.",
    "Far more thought and care go into the composition of any prominent ad in a newspaper or magazine than go into the writing of their features and editorials.",
    "The bible belt is oral territory and therefore despised by the literati.",
    "Artists in various fields are always the first to discover how to enable one medium or to release the power of another.",

    "Pornography and violence are by-products of societies in which private identity has been ... destroyed by sudden environmental change.",
    "The literate man is a sucker for propaganda...You cannot propagandize a native. You can sell him rum and trinkets, but you cannot sell him ideas.",
    "Only the vanquished remember history.",
    "Control over change would seem to consist in moving not with it but ahead of it. Anticipation gives the power to deflect and control force.",
    "A moral point of view too often serves as a substitute for understanding in technological matters.",
    "As technology advances, it reverses the characteristics of every situation again and again. The age of automation is going to be the age of 'do it yourself.'",
    "First we shape our tools, thereafter they shape us",
    "Any ad consciously attended to is comical. Ads are not meant for conscious consumption. They are intended as subliminal pills for the subconsious in order to exercise an hypnotic spell, especially on sociologists.",

    "Darkness is to space what silence is to sound, i.e., the interval.",
    "Whence did the wond'rous mystic art arise, / Of painting SPEECH, and speaking to the eyes? / That we by tracing magic lines are taught, / How to embody, and to colour THOUGHT?",
    "Today's child is growing up absurd, because he lives in two worlds, and neither of them inclines him to grow up. Growing up--thatis our new work, and it is total. Mere instruction will not suffice.",
    "Television brought the brutality of war into the comfort of the living room. Vietnam was lost in the living rooms of America - not on the battlefields of Vietnam.",
    "Transmitted at the speed of light, all events on this planet are simultaneous. In the electric environment of information all events are simultaneous, there is no time or space separating events.",
    "Education in a technological world of replaceable and expendable parts is neuter.",
    "In this electronic age we see ourselves being translated more and more into the form of information, moving toward the technological extension of consciousness.",
    "The alphabet and print technology fostered and encouraged a fragmenting process, a process of specialism and detachment. Electric technology fosters and encourages unification and involvement.",

    "When things come at you very fast, naturally you lose touch with yourself.",
    "The subliminal depths of radio are charged with the resonating echoes of tribal horns and antique drums. This is inherent in the very nature of this medium, with its power to turn the\npsyche and society into a single echo chamber.",
    "Phenomenology is dialectic in ear-mode - a massive and decentralized quest for roots, for ground.",
    "In large measure, writing is the spatialization of thought.",
    "The family circle has widened. The worldpool of information fathered by the electric media--movies, Telstar, flight--far surpassesany possible influence mom and dad can now bring to bear. Character no longer is shaped by only two earnest, fumbling experts. Now all the world's a sage.",
    "Canadians are the people who learned to live without the bold accents of the natural ego-trippers of other lands.",
    "The world of visual perspective is one of unified and homogeneous space. Such a world is alien to the resonating diversity of spoken words. So language was the last art to accept the visual logic of Gutenberg technology, and the first to rebound in the electric age.",
    "Language as the technology of human extension, whose powers of division and separation we know so well, may have been the \"Tower of Babel\" by which men sought to scale the highest heavens. Today computers hold out the promise of a means of instant tr",

    "The content or message of any particular medium has about as much importance as the stenciling on the casing of an atomic bomb.",
    "The wheel is an extension of the foot, the book is an extension of the eye, clothing an extension of the skin, electric circuitry an extension of the central nervous system.",

    "Human perception is literally incarnation.",
    "The photograph reverses the purpose of travel, which until now had been to encounter the strange and unfamiliar.",
    "TV acting is so extremely intimate, because of the peculiar involvement of the viewer with the completion or \"closing\" of the TV image, that the actor must achieve a great degree of spontaneous casualness that would be irrelevant in movie and lost on the stage. For the audience participates in the inner life of the TV actor as fully as in the outer life of the movie star. Technically, TV tends to be a close-up medium. The close-up that in the movie is used for shock is, on TV, a quite casual thing.",

    "We impose the form of the old on the content of the new.",
    "The artist is the man in any field, scientific or humanistic, who grasps the implications of his actions and of new knowledge in his own time. He is the man of integral awareness.",

    "Madison Avenue is a very powerful aggression against private consciousness. A demand that you yield your private consciousness to public manipulation.",

    "Innovation for holders of conventional wisdom is not novelty but annihilation.",
    "Even mud gives the illusion of depth.",
    "Gramophone and movies were merely the mechanization of speech and gesture. But the radio and TV were not just the electronification of speech and gesture but the electronification of the entire range of human personal expressiveness. With electronification the flow is taken out of the wire and into the vacuum tube circuit, which confers freedom and flexibility such as are in metaphor and in words themselves.",
    "Every innovation scraps its immediate predecessor and retrieves still older figures â€“ it causes floods of antiques or nostalgic art forms and stimulates the search for museum pieces.",
    "The movie stars and matinee idols are put into the public domain by photography. They become dreams that money can buy. They can be bought and thumbed more easily than public prostitutes.",

    "A typewriter is a means of transcribing thought, not expressing it.",

    "As the age of information demands the simultaneous use of all our faculties, we discover that we are most at leisure when we are most intensely involved.",
    "Except for light, all other media come in pairs, with one acting as the \"content\" of the other, obscuring the operation of both.",
    "My main theme is the extension of the nervous system in the electric age, and thus, the complete break with five thousand years of mechanical technology. This I state over and over again. I do not say whether it is a good or bad thing. To do so would be meaningless and arrogant.",
    "To see a man slip on a banana skin is to see a rationally structured system suddenly translated into a whirling machine.",
    "The past went that-a-way. When faced with a totally new situation, we tend always to attach ourselves to the objects, to the flavor of the most recent past. We look at the present through a rear view mirror. We march backwards into the future.",

    "A successful book cannot afford to be more than ten percent new.",
    "The student of media soon comes to expect the New Media of any period whatever to be classed as 'pseudo' by those who acquired the patterns of earlier media, whatever they may happen to be.",
    "Our electrically-configured world has forced us to move from the habit of data classification to the mode of pattern recognition. We can no longer build serially, block-by-block, step-by-step, because instant communication insures that all factors of the environment and of experience co-exist in a state of active interplay.",

    "It is perhaps typical of very creative minds that they hit very large nails not quite on the head.",
    "Such is the content of the mental life of the Hemingway hero and the good guy in general. Every day he gets beaten into a servile pulp by his own mechanical reflexes, which are constantly busy registering and reacting to the violent stimuli which his big, noisy, kinesthetic environment has provided for his unreflective reception.",

    "Most clear writing is a sign that there is no exploration going on. Clear prose indicates the absence of thought.",
    "Persons grouped around a fire or candle for warmth or light are less able to pursue independent thoughts, or even tasks, than people supplied with electric light. In the same way, the social and educational patterns latent in automation are those of self-employment and artistic autonomy.",

    "[Cameras] tend to turn people into things and the photograph extends and multiplies the human image to the proportions of mass-produced merchandise and, [in the age of photography] the world itself becomes a sort of museum of objects that have been encountered before in some other museum and to say that the camera cannot lie is merely to underline the multiple deceits that are now practiced in its name.",

    "The suddenness of the leap from hardware to software cannot but produce a period of anarchy and collapse, especially in the developed countries.",
    "In experimental art, men are given the exact specifications of coming violence to their own psyches from their own counter-irritant or technology... But the counter-irritant usually proves a greater plague than the initial irritant, like a drug habit.",

We almost never think of the present, and if we do think of it, it is only to see what light is throws on our plans for the future. The present is never our end. The past and the present are our means, the future alone our end. Thus we never actually live, but hope to live, and since we are always planning how to be happy, it is inevitable that we should never be so.",

Then they feel their nullity without recognizing it, for nothing could be more wretched than to be intolerably depressed as soon as one is reduced to introspection with no means of diversion.",
    "There is enough light for those who only desire to see, and enough obscurity for those who have a contrary disposition",
    "Cold words freeze people, and hot words scorch them, and bitter words make them bitter, and wrathful words make them wrathful. Kind words also produce their own image on men's souls; and a beautiful image it is. They smooth, and quiet, and comfort the hearer.",

    "We never love a person, but only qualities.",
    "All the maxims have been written. It only remains to put them into practice.",

    "All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever different means they employ, they all tend to this end.

This is the motive of every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves.",
    "There are two excesses: to exclude reason, to admit nothing but reason. The supreme achievement of reason is to realise that there is a limit to reason. Reason's last step is the recognition that there are an infinite number of things which are beyond it. It is merely feeble if it does not go as far as to realise that.",

    "If we let ourselves believe that man began with divine grace, that he forfeited this by sin, and that he can be redeemed only by divine grace through the crucified Christ, then we shall find peace of mind never granted to philosophers. He who cannot believe is cursed, for he reveals by his unbelief that God has not chosen to give him grace.",
    "Man is obviously made for thinking. Therein lies all his dignity and his merit; and his whole duty is to think as he ought.",
    "Men despise religion. They hate it and are afraid it may be true. The cure for this is first to show that religion is not contrary to reason, but worthy of reverence and respect. Next make it attractive, make good men wish it were true and then show that it is.",

    "What part of us feels pleasure? Is it our hand, our arm, our flesh, or our blood? It must obviously be something immaterial.",
    "We know that there is an infinite, and we know not its nature. As we know it to be false that numbers are finite, it is therefore true that there is a numerical infinity. But we know not of what kind; it is untrue that it is even, untrue that it is odd; for the addition of a unit does not change its nature; yet it is a number, and every number is odd or even (this certainly holds of every finite number). Thus we may quite well know that there is a God without knowing what He is.",

    "Fashion is a tyrant from which nothing frees us. We must suit ourselves to its fantastic tastes. But being compelled to live under its foolish laws, the wise man is never the first to follow, nor the last to keep it.",
    "There are two equally dangerous extremes-to shut reason out, and to let nothing else in.",
    "Nature imitates herself. A grain thrown into good ground brings forth fruit; a principle thrown into a good mind brings forth fruit. Everything is created and conducted by the same Master-the root, the branch, the fruits-the principles, the consequences.",
    "There is nothing that we can see on earth which does not either show the wretchedness of man or the mercy of God. One either sees the powerlessness of man without God, or the strength of man with God.",

    "What can be seen on earth points to neither the total absence nor the obvious presence of divinity, but to the presence of a hidden God. Everything bears this mark.",
    "When we would show any one that he is mistaken, our best course is to observe on what side he considers the subject,--for his view of if is generally right on this side,--and admit to him that he is right so far. He will be satisfied with this acknowledgment, that he was not wrong in his judgment, but only inadvertent in not looking at the whole case.",
    "If god does not exist, one loses nothing by believing in him anyway, while if he does exist, one stands to lose everything by not believing.",

    "It is impossible on reasonable grounds to disbelieve miracles.",
    "Chess is the gymnasium of the mind.",
    "So we can only know God well by knowing our iniquities. Therefore those who have known God, without knowing their wretchedness, have not glorified Him, but have glorified themselves.",
    "It is dangerous to explain too clearly to man how like he is to the animals without pointing out his greatness. It is also dangerous to make too much of his greatness without his vileness. It is still more dangerous to leave him in ignorance of both, but it is most valuable to represent both to him. Man must not be allowed to believe that he is equal either to animals or to angels, nor to be unaware of either, but he must know both.",
    "Eloquence is a way of saying things in such a way, first, that those to whom we speak may listen to them without pain and with pleasure, and second, that they feel themselves interested, so that self-love leads them more willingly to reflection upon it.",
    "All men seek happiness. There are no exceptions.... This is the motive of every act of every man, including those who go and hang themselves.",
    "If God exists, not seeking God must be the gravest error imaginable. If one decides to sincerely seek for God and doesn't find God, the lost effort is negligible in comparison to what is at risk in not seeking God in the first place.",

    "I do not admire a virtue like valour when it is pushed to excess, if I do not see at the same time the excess of the opposite virtue, as one does in Epaminondas, who displayed extreme valour and extreme benevolence. For otherwise it is not an ascent, but a fall. We do not display our greatness by placing ourselves at one extremity, but rather by being at both at the same time, and filling up the whole of the space between them.",

The man who knows his own misery but does not know God, ends in despair...the knowledge of Jesus Christ constitutes the middle course because in him we find both God and our own misery. Jesus Christ is therefore a God whom we approach without pride, and before whom we humble ourselves without despair.",

    "When I see the blind and wretched state of men, when I survey the whole universe in its deadness, and man left to himself with no light, as though lost in this corner of the universe without knowing who put him there, what he has to do, or what will become of him when he dies, incapable of knowing anything, I am moved to terror, like a man transported in his sleep to some terrifying desert island, who wakes up quite lost, with no means of escape. Then I marvel that so wretched a state does not drive people to despair.",
    "The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.",
    "It is not certain that everything is uncertain.",
    "Our soul is cast into a body, where it finds number, time, dimension. Thereupon it reasons, and calls this nature necessity, and can believe nothing else.",
    "Nothing is so intolerable to man as being fully at rest, without passion, without business, without entertainment, without care.

    "There are people who lie simply for the sake of lying.",
    "One of the greatest artifices the devil uses to engage men in vice and debauchery, is to fasten names of contempt on certain virtues, and thus fill weak souls with a foolish fear of passing for scrupulous, should they desire to put them in practice.",

    "Let man reawake and consider what he is compared with the reality of things; regard himself lost in this remote corner of Nature; and from the tiny cell where he lodges, to wit the Universe, weigh at their true worth earth, kingdoms, towns, himself. What is a man face to face with infinity?",

    "Kind words produce their own image in men's souls; and a beautiful image it is. They soothe and quiet and comfort the hearer. They shame him out of his sour, morose, unkind feelings. We have not yet begun to use kind words in such abundance as they ought to be used.",
    "Parents fear the destruction of natural affection in their children. What is this natural principle so liable to decay? Habit is a second nature, which destroys the first. Why is not custom nature? I suspect that this nature itself is but a first custom, as custom is a second nature.",

    "The gospel to me is simply irresistible.",
    "How can anyone lose who chooses to become a Christian? If, when he dies, there turns out to be no God and his faith was in vain, he has lost nothing...If, however, there is a God and a heaven and a hell. then he has gained heaven and his skeptical friends have lost everything.",

    "When one does not love too much, one does not love enough.",
    "All the excesses, all the violence, and all the vanity of great men, come from the fact that they know not what they are: it being difficult for those who regard themselves at heart as\nequal with all men... For this it is necessary for one to forget himself, and to believe that he has some real excellence above them, in which consists this illusion that I am endeavoring to\ndiscover to you.",

    "[Unbelievers] think they have made great efforts to get at the truth when they have spent a few hours in reading some book out of Holy Scripture, and have questioned some cleric about the truths of the faith. After that, they boast that they have searched in books and among men in vain.",

    "Let us imagine a number of men in chains and all condemned to death, where some are killed each day in the sight of the others, and those who remain see their own fate in that of their fellows and wait their turn, looking at each other sorrowfully and without hope. It is an image of the condition of man.",
    "The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing. We feel it in a thousand things. I say that the heart naturally loves the Universal Being, and naturally loves itself; and it gives itself to one or the other, and hardens itself against one or the other, as it chooses...it is the heart that feels God, not the reason; this is faith.",
    "God only pours out his light into the mind after having subdued the rebellion of the will by an altogether heavenly gentleness which charms and wins it.",
    "We know truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart.",
    "Nothing is so important to man as his own state; nothing is so formidable to him as eternity. And thus it is unnatural that thereshould be men indifferent to the loss of their existence and to the perils of everlasting suffering.",
    "We think very little of time present; we anticipate the future, as being too slow, and with a view to hasten it onward, we recall the past to stay it as too swiftly gone.

    "The immortality of the soul is a matter which is of so great consequence to us and which touches us so profoundly that we must have lost all feeling to be indifferent about it.",
    "The only shame is to have none.",
    "No one is offended at not seeing everything; but one does not like to be mistaken, and that perhaps arises from the fact that man naturally cannot see everything, and that naturally he cannot err in the side he looks at, since the perceptions of our senses are always true.",
    "The greatness of man is so evident that it is even proved by his wretchedness. For what in animals is nature, we call in man wretchedness--by which we recognize that, his nature being now like that of animals, he has fallen from a better nature which once was his.",
    "Dull minds are never either intuitive or mathematical.",
    "For after all what is man in nature? A nothing in relation to infinity, all in relation to nothing, a central point between nothing and all and infinitely far from understanding either. The ends of things and their beginnings are impregnably concealed from him in an impenetrable secret. He is equally incapable of seeing the nothingness out of which he was drawn and the infinite in which he is engulfed.",
    "Man is to himself the most wonderful object in nature; for he cannot conceive what the body is, still less what the mind is, and least of all how a body should be united to a mind. This is\n the consummation of his difficulties, and yet it is his very being.",
    "If we examine our thoughts, we shall find them always occupied with the past or the future.",

    "All I know is that I must soon die, but what I know least is this very death which I cannot escape.",
    "St. Augustine teaches us that there is in each man a Serpent, an Eve, and an Adam. Our senses and natural propensities are the Serpent; the excitable desire is the Eve; and reason is the Adam.

    "The greater intellect one has, the more originality one finds in men. Ordinary persons find no difference between men.",
    "We conceal it from ourselves in vain - we must always love something. In those matters seemingly removed from love, the feeling is secretly to be found, and man cannot possibly live for a moment without it.",
    "If a man loves a woman for her beauty, does he love her? No; for the smallpox, which destroys her beauty without killing her, causes his love to cease. And if any one loves me for my judgment or my memory, does he really love me? No; for I can lose these qualities without ceasing to be.",
    "Earnestness is enthusiasm tempered by reason.",

    "The best defense against logic is ignorance.",
    "What a strange vanity painting is; it attracts admiration by resembling the original, we do not admire.",
    "If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since, having, neither parts nor limits, He has no affinity to us. We are then incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is. [So] you must wager. Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager then without hesitation that he is.",

    "He who does not know his way to the sea should take a river for his guide.",
    "Il n'y a que deux sortes d'hommes: les uns justes, qui se croient pe  cheurs; les autres pe  cheurs, qui se croient justes. There are only two types of people: the virtuous who believe themselves to be sinners and the sinners who believe themselves to be virtuous.",

    "There is nothing so insupportable to man as to be in entire repose, without passion, occupation, amusement, or application.

    "He who cannot believe is cursed, for he reveals by his unbelief that God has not chosen to give him grace.",
    "It is dangerous to tell the people that the laws are unjust; for they obey them only because they think them just. Therefore it isnecessary to tell them at the same time that they must obey them because they are laws, just as they must obey superiors, not because they are just, but because they are superiors. In this way all sedition is prevented.",

    "To deny, to believe, and to doubt well, are to a man what the race is to a horse.",
    "Our senses perceive no extreme. Too much sound deafens us; too much light dazzles us; too great distance or proximity hinders ourview. Too great length and too great brevity of discourse tends to obscurity; too much truth is paralyzing.... In short, extremes are for us as though they were not, and we are not within their notice. They escape us, or we them.",

    "Man is so made that by continually telling him he is a fool he believes it, and by continually telling it to himself he makes himself believe it. For man holds an inward talk with himself, which it pays him to regulate.",
    "Whilst in speaking of human things, we say that it is necessary to know them before we love can them. The saints on the contrary say in speaking of divine things that it is necessary to love them in order to know them, and that we only enter truth through charity.",

She would be the infallible rule of truth if she were the infallible rule of falsehood; but being only most frequently in error, she gives no evidence of her real quality, for she marks with the same character both that which is true and that which is false.",
    "The law required what it could not give. Grace gives that which it requires.",
    "To go beyond the bounds of moderation is to outrage humanity.",
    "All great amusements are dangerous to the Christian life; but among all those which the world has invented there is none more to be feared than the theater. It is a representation of the passions so natural and so delicate that it excites them and gives birth to them in our hearts, and, above all, to that of love.",
    "Our nature consists in motion; complete rest is death.",

    "The serene, silent beauty of a holy life is the most powerful influence in the world, next to the night of God.",
    "We know then the existence and nature of the finite, because we also are finite and have extension. We know the existence of the infinite and are ignorant of its nature, because it has extension like us, but not limits like us.

    "Anyone who found the secret of rejoicing when things go well without being annoyed when they go badly would have found the point.",
    "Let us, then, take our compass; we are something, and we are not everything. The nature of our existence hides from us the knowledge of first beginnings which are born of the nothing; and the littleness of our being conceals from us the sight of the infinite. Our intellect holds the same position in the world of thought as our body occupies in the expanse of nature.",
    "There is a certain standard of grace and beauty which consists in a certain relation between our nature, such as it is, weak or strong, and the thing which pleases us. Whatever is formed according to this standard pleases us, be it house, song, discourse, verse, prose, woman, birds, rivers, trees, room, dress, and so on. Whatever is not made according to this standard displeases those who have good taste.",
    "At the centre of every human being is a God-shaped vacuum which can only be filled by Jesus Christ.",

    "Imagination magnifies small objects with fantastic exaggeration until they fill our soul, and with bold insolence cuts down great things to its own size, as when speaking of God.",
    "There is a virtuous fear, which is the effect of faith; and there is a vicious fear, which is the product of doubt. The former leads to hope, as relying on God, in whom we believe; the latter inclines to despair, as not relying on God, in whom we do not believe. Persons of the one character fear to lose God; persons of the other character fear to find Him.",
    "Justice and power must be brought together, so that whatever is just may be powerful, and whatever is powerful may be just.",
    "When we are in love we seem to ourselves quite different from what we were before.",
    "One has followed the other in an endless circle, for it is certain that as man's insight increases so he finds both wretchedness and greatness within himself. In a word man knows he is wretched. Thus he is wretched because he is so, but he is truly great because he knows it.",
    "Nature is an infinite sphere of which the center is everywhere and the circumference nowhere.",
    "Our imagination so magnifies this present existence, by the power of continual reflection on it, and so attenuates eternity, by not thinking of it at all, that we reduce an eternity to nothingness, and expand a mere nothing to an eternity; and this habit is so inveterately rooted in us that all the force of reason cannot induce us to lay it aside.",
    "The world is satisfied with words. Few appreciate the things beneath.\n[Fr., Le monde se paye de paroles; peu approfondissement les choses.]",
    "The two principles of truth, reason and senses, are not only both not genuine, but are engaged in mutual deception. The senses deceive reason through false appearances, and the senses are disturbed by passions, which produce false impressions.",
    "If we do not know ourselves to be full of pride, ambition, lust, weakness, misery, and injustice, we are indeed blind. And if, knowing this, we do not desire deliverance, what can we say of a man...?",
    "To speak freely of mathematics, I find it the highest exercise of the spirit; but at the same time I know that it is so useless that I make little distinction between a man who is only a mathematician and a common artisan. Also, I call it the most beautiful profession in the world; but it is only a profession.",
    "Il y a deux sortes d'esprits, l'un ge  ome  trique, et l'autre que l'on peut appeler de finesse. Le premier a des vues lentes, dures et inflexibles; mais le dernier a une souplesse de pense  e. There are two kinds of mind, one mathematical, the other what one might call the intuitive. The first takes a slow, firm, inflexible view, but the latter has flexibility of thought.",
    "The world is satisfied with words, few care to dive beneath the surface.",
    "This is what I see, and what troubles me. I look on all sides, and everywhere I see nothing but obscurity. Nature offers me nothing that is not a matter of doubt and disquiet.",
    "All men are almost led to believe not of proof, but by attraction. This way is base, ignoble, and irrelevant; every one therefore disavows it. Each one professes to believe and even to love\nnothing but what he knows to be worthy of belief and love.",
    "We are fools to depend upon the society of our fellow-men. Wretched as we are, powerless as we are, they will not aid us; we shall die alone.",
    "The parts of the universe ... all are connected with each other in such a way that I think it to be impossible to understand any one without the whole.",
    "The consciousness of the falsity of present pleasures, and the ignorance of the vanity of absent pleasures, cause inconstancy.",
    "No soul of high estate can take pleasure in slander. It betrays a weakness.",
    "As men are not able to fight against death, misery, ignorance, they have taken it into their heads, in order to be happy, not to think of them at all.",
    "The Church limits her sacramental services to the faithful. Christ gave Himself upon the cross a ransom for all.",
    "We sail within a vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end.",

    "Men are so necessarily mad, that not to be mad would amount to another form of madness.",
    "The pagans do not know God, and love only the earth. The Jews know the true God, and love only the earth. The Christians know the true God, and do not love the earth.",
    "[Christianity] endeavors equally to establish these two things: that God has set up in the Church visible signs to make himself known to those who should seek him sincerely, and that he has nevertheless so disguised them that he will only be perceived by those who seek him with all their heart.",
    "True eloquence makes light of eloquence.  True morality makes light of morality.",
    "The heart has its reasons, which Reason does not know. We feel it in a thousand things. It is the heart which feels God, and not Reason. This, then, is perfect faith: God felt in the heart.",
    "How hollow is the heart of man, and how full of excrement!",
    "A mere trifle consoles us, for a mere trifle distresses us.",
    "Christianity is strange. It bids man recognise that he is vile, even abominable, and bids him desire to be like God. Without such a counterpoise, this dignity would make him horribly vain, or this humiliation would make him terribly abject.",
    "Nothing fortifies scepticism more than that there are some who are not sceptics; if all were so, they would be wrong.",
    "We are so presumptuous that we should like to be known all over the world, even by people who will only come when we are no more. Such is our vanity that the good opinion of half a dozen of the people around us gives us pleasure and satisfaction.",
    "Each man is everything to himself, for with his death everything is dead for him. That is why each of us thinks he is everything to everyone. We must not judge nature by ourselves, but by its own standards.",
    "The finite is annihilated in the presence of the infinite, and becomes a pure nothing. So our spirit before God, so our justice before divine justice.",
    "It is a dangerous experiment to call in gratitude as an ally to love. Love is a debt which inclination always pays, obligation never.",
    "We sail within a vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end. When we think to attach ourselves to any pointand to fasten to it, it wavers and leaves us; and if we follow it, it eludes our grasp, slips past us, and vanishes for ever. Nothing stays for us.",
    "Atheism shows strength of mind, but only to a certain degree.",
    "We like to be deceived.",
    "Man is clearly made to think. It is his whole dignity and his whole merit; and his whole duty is to think as he ought. And the order of thought is to begin with ourselves, and with our Author and our end.",

    "The eternal Being is forever if he is at all.",
    "Perfect clarity would profit the intellect but damage the will.",
    "We know the truth not only through our reason but also through our heart. It is through the latter that we know first principles, and reason, which has nothing to do with it, tries in vain to refute them.",
    "If a soldier or labourer complain of the hardship of his lot, set him to do nothing.",
    "Man is so made that if he is told often enough that he is a fool he believes it.",
    "Man is only a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed. There is no need for the whole universe to take up arms to crush him: a vapour, a drop of water is enough to kill him. but even if the universe were to crush him, man would still be nobler than his slayer, because he knows that he is dying and the advantage the universe has over him. The universe knows none of this.",
    "All of our miseries prove our greatness. They are the miseries of a dethroned monarch.",
    "It is the contest that delights us, and not the victory.",
    "Reason's last step is to acknowledge that there are infinitely many things\nbeyond it.",
    "If they [Plato and Aristotle] wrote about politics it was as if to lay down rules for a madhouse. And if they pretended to treat it as something really important it was because they knew that the madmen they were talking to believed themselves to be kings and emperors. They humored these beliefs in order to calm down their madness with as little harm as possible.",
    "Those we call the ancients were really new in everything.",
    "Great and small suffer the same mishaps.",
    "When some passion or effect is described in a natural style, we find within ourselves the truth of what we hear, without knowing it was there.",
    "If he exalts himself, I humble him. If he humbles himself, I exalt him. And I go on contradicting him Until he understands That he is a monster that passes all understanding.",
    "There should be in eloquence that which is pleasing and that which is real; but that which is pleasing should itself be real.",
    "As we speak of poetical beauty, so ought we to speak of mathematical beauty and medical beauty. But we do not do so; and that reason is that we know well what is the object of mathematics, and that it consists in proofs, and what is the object of medicine, and that it consists in healing. But we do not know in what grace consists, which is the object of poetry.",
    "Faith indeed tells what the senses do not tell, but not the contrary of what they see. It is above them and not contrary to them.",
    "Vanity of science. Knowledge of physical science will not console me for ignorance of morality in time of affliction, but knowledge of morality will always console me for ignorance of physical science.",
    "Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them; no art can keep or acquire them.",
    "Let each of us examine his thoughts",
    "We have so exalted a notion of the human soul that we cannot bear to be despised, or even not to be esteemed by it. Man, in fact, places all his happiness in this esteem.",
    "The heart has its order, the mind has its own, which uses principles and demonstrations. The heart has a different one. We do not prove that we ought to be loved by setting out in order the causes of love; that would be absurd.",
    "Nothing is thoroughly approved but mediocrity. The majority has established this, and it fixes its fangs on whatever gets beyond it either way.",
    "A little thing comforts us because a little thing afflicts us.",
    "It is not from space that I must seek my dignity, but from the government of my thought. I shall have no more if I possess worlds. By space the universe encompasses and swallows me up like an atom; by thought I comprehend the world.",
    "Vanity is so anchored in the heart of man that a soldier, a soldier's servant, a cook, a porter brags and wishes to have his admirers. Even philosophers wish for them. Those who write against vanity want to have the glory of having written well; and those who read it desire the glory of having read it. I who write this have perhaps this desire, and perhaps those who will read it.",
    "The war existing between the senses and reason.",
    "Sneezing absorbs all the functions of the soul just as much as the [sexual] act, but we do not draw from it the same conclusions against the greatness of man, because it is involuntary; although we bring it about, we do so involuntarily. It is not for the sake of the thing in itself but for another end, and is therefore not a sign of man's weakness, or his subjection to this act.",
    "Pride counterbalances all our miseries, for it either hides them, or, if it discloses them, boasts of that disclosure. Pride has such a thorough possession of us, even in the midst of our miseries and faults, that we are prepared to sacrifice life with joy, if it may but be talked of.",
    "The last advance of reason is to recognize that it is surpassed by innumerable things; it is feeble if it cannot realize that.",
    "If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation, that He exists.",
    "Let no one say that I have said nothing new... the arrangement of the subject is new. When we play tennis, we both play with the same ball, but one of us places it better.",
    "All the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber.",
    "To have no time for philosophy is to be a true philosopher.",

    "The present letter is a very long one, simply because I had no leisure to make it shorter.",
    "Our nature lies in movement; complete calm is death.",
    "Nothing is good but mediocrity. The majority has settled that, and finds fault with him who escapes it at whichever end... To leave the mean is to abandon humanity.",
    "Rivers are roads which move, and which carry us whither we desire to go.",
    "It is not good to be too free. It is not good to have all one wants.",
    "The last thing we decide in writing a book is what to put first.",
    "To ridicule philosophy is truly philosophical.\n[Fr., Se moquer de la philosophie c'est vraiment philosophe.]",
    "Man is so great that his greatness appears even in the consciousness of his misery. A tree does not know itself to be miserable. It is true that it is misery indeed to know one's self to be miserable; but then it is greatness also. In this way, all man's miseries go to prove his greatness. They are the miseries of a mighty potentate, of a dethroned monarch.",
    "There is a lot of difference between tempting and leading into error. God tempts but does not lead into error. To tempt is to provide opportunities for us to do certain things if we do not love God, but putting us under no necessity to do so. To lead into error is to compel a man necessarily to conclude and follow a falsehood.",
    "The God of the infinite is the God of the infinitesimal.",
    "The mind must not be forced; artificial and constrained manners fill it with foolish presumption, through unnatural elevation and vain and ridiculous inflation, instead of solid and\nvigorous nutriment.",
    "When we read too fast or too slowly, we understand nothing.",
    "Men blaspheme what they do not know.",
    "God is, or He is not.\" But to which side shall we incline? Reason can decide nothing here. There is an infinite chaos which separated us. A game is being played at the extremity of this infinite distance where heads or tails will turn up. What will you wager?",
    "Lust is the source of all our actions, and humanity.",
    "I can well conceive a man without hands, feet, head. But I cannot conceive man without thought; he would be a stone or a brute.",
    "Ugly deeds are most estimable when hidden.",
    "We do not worry about being respected in towns through which we pass. But if we are going to remain in one for a certain time, we do worry. How long does this time have to be?",

    "Losses are comparative; imagination only makes them of any moment.",
    "Custom creates the whole of equity, for the simple reason that it is accepted.",
    "Continuous eloquence is tedious.",
    "When we see an effect happen always in the same manner, we infer that it takes place by a natural necessity; as, for instance, that the sun will rise to morrow; but nature often deceives us, and will not submit to its own rules.",
    "All mankind's unhappiness derives from one thing: his inability to know how to remain in repose in one room.",
    "Man's true nature being lost, everything becomes his nature; as, his true good being lost, everything becomes his good.",
    "It is not shameful for a man to succumb to pain and it is shameful to succumb to pleasure.",
    "How vain is painting, which is admired for reproducing the likeness of things whose originals are not admired.",
    "The truth about nature we discover with our brains. The truth about religion we discover with our hearts.",
    "I have spent much time in the study of the abstract sciences; but the paucity of persons with whom you can communicate on such subjects disgusted me with them. When I began to study man, I saw that these abstract sciences are not suited to him, and that in diving into them, I wandered farther from my real object than those who knew them not, and I forgave them for not having attended to these things. I expected then, however, that I should find some companions in the study of man, since it was so specifically a duty. I was in error. There are fewer students of man than of geometry.",
    "I know whom I have believed.",

    "Man governs himself more by impulse than reason",
    "Montaigne is wrong in declaring that custom ought to be followed simply because it is custom, and not because it is reasonable or just.",
    "La chose la plus importante a'   toute la vie est le choix du me  tier: le hasard en dispose. The most important thing in life is to choose a profession: chance arranges for that.",
    "It is natural for the mind to believe and for the will to love; so that, for want of true objects, they must attach themselves to false.",
    "Any unity which doesn't have its origin in the multitudes is tyranny.",
    "The secrets of nature are concealed; her agency is perpetual, but we do not always discover its effects; time reveals them from age to age; and although she is always the same in herself, she is not always equally well known.",
    "How vain painting is, exciting admiration by its resemblance to things of which we do not admire the originals.",

    "Le silence est la plus grande perse  cution: jamais les saints ne se sont tus. Silence is the greatest of all persecutions: no saint was ever silent.",
    "Discourses on humility are a source of pride in the vain and of humility in the humble.",
    "Man is nothing but insincerity, falsehood, and hypocrisy, both in regard to himself and in regard to others. He does not wish that he should be told the truth, he shuns saying it to others; and all these moods, so inconsistent with justice and reason, have their roots in his heart.",
    "Look for the truth, it wants to be found.",
    "There was once in man a true happiness of which there now remain to him only the mark and empty trace, which he in vain tries to fill from all his surroundings, seeking from things absent the help he does not obtain in things present.",
    "Opinion is the queen of the world.",
    "Something incomprehensible is not for that reason less real.",
    "It is your own assent to yourself, and the constant voice of your own reason, and not of others, that should make you believe.",
    "By space the universe encompasses and swallows me up like an atom; by thought I comprehend the world.",
    "We desire truth, and find within ourselves only uncertainty. We seek happiness, and find only misery and death. We cannot but desire truth and happiness, and are incapable of certainty or happiness.",
    "I have made this letter longer than usual, only because I have not had the time to make it shorter.",
    "The Christian's God does not merely consist of a God who is the Author of mathematical truths and the order of the elements. The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of the Christians, is a God of love and consolation.",
    "Nature, which alone is good, is wholly familiar and common.",
    "Things are always at their best in their beginning.",
    "Our senses will not admit anything extreme. Too much noise confuses us, too much light dazzles us, too great distance or nearness prevents vision, too great prolixity or brevity weakens an argument, too much pleasure gives pain, too much accordance annoys.",

    "It is not permitted to the most equitable of men to be a judge in his own cause.",
    "Truly it is an evil to be full of faults; but it is a still greater evil to be full of them and to be unwilling to recognize them, since that is to add the further fault of a voluntary illusion.",
    "Clarity of mind means clarity of passion, too.",
    "Quand on voit le style naturel, on est tout e  tonne   et ravi, car on s'attendait de voir un auteur, et on trouve un homme. When we see a natural style we are quite amazed and delighted, because we expected to see an author and find a man.",
    "Since we cannot be universal and know all that is to be known of everything, we ought to know a little about everything. For it is far better to know something about everything than to know all about one thing. This universality is the best. If we can have both, still better; but if we must choose, we ought to choose the former.",
    "Must we kill to prevent there being any wicked? This is to make both parties wicked instead of one.",
    "Custom determines what is agreeable.",

    "La vraie e  loquence se moque de l'e  loquence, la vraie morale se moque de la morale. True eloquence has notime foreloquence, true morality has no time for morality.",
    "The origins of disputes between philosophers is, that one class of them have undertaken to raise man by displaying his greatness, and the other to debase him by showing his miseries.",
    "Imagination cannot make fools wise, but it makes them happy, as against reason, which only makes its friends wretched: one covers them with glory, the other with shame.",

Voila le commencement et l'image de l'usurpation de toute la terre.]",
    "When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, one feels within oneself the truth of what one reads, which was there before, although one did not know it. Hence one is inclined to love him who makes us feel it, for he has not shown us his own riches, but ours. ...such community of intellect that we have with him necessarily inclines the heart to love.",
    "If there were only one religion, God would indeed be manifest.",

    "You corrupt religion either in favour of your friends, or against your enemies.",
    "Mediocrity makes the most of its native possessions.",
    "The mind of the greatest man on earth is not so independent of circumstances as not to feel inconvenienced by the merest buzzing noise about him; it does not need the report of a cannon to disturb his thoughts. The creaking of a vane or a pully is quite enough. Do not wonder that he reasons ill just now; a fly is buzzing by his ear; it is quite enough to unfit him for giving good counsel.",
    "We do not content ourselves with the life we have in ourselves and in our being; we desire to live an imaginary life in the mind of others, and for this purpose we endeavor to shine. We labor unceasingly to adorn and preserve this imaginary existence and neglect the real.",
    "Not to be mad is another form of madness",
    "To go beyond the bounds of moderation is to outrage humanity. The greatness of the human soul is shown by knowing how to keep within proper bounds. There are two equally dangerous extremes- to shut reason out, and not to let nothing in.",
    "When we do not know the truth of a thing, it is good that there should exist a common error which determines the mind of man, as, for example, the moon, to which is attributed the change of seasons, the progress of diseases, etc. For the chief malady of man is a restless curiosity about things which he cannot understand; and it is not so bad for him to be in error as to be curious to no purpose.",
    "Each one is all in all to himself; for being dead, all is dead to him.",
    "The only thing which consoles for our miseries is diversion, and yet this is the greatest of our miseries. For it is this which principally hinders us from reflecting upon ourselves and which makes us imperceptibly ruin ourselves.",
    "Symmetry is what we see at a glance; based on the fact that there is no reason for any difference.",
    "Without [diversion] we would be in a state of weariness, and this weariness would spur us on to seek a more solid means of escaping from it. But diversion amuses us, and leads us unconsciously to death.",
    "Thinking too little about things or thinking too much both make us obstinate and fanatical.",
    "Extremes are for us as though they were not, and we are not within their notice. They escape us, or we them. This is our true state; this is what makes us incapable of certain knowledge and of absolute ignorance... This is our natural condition, and yet most contrary to our inclination; we burn with desire to find solid ground and an ultimate sure foundation whereon to build a tower reaching to the Infinite. But our whole groundwork cracks, and the earth opens to abysses.",
    "Eloquence is the painting of thought.",
    "Do little things as if they were great, because of the majesty of the Lord Jesus Christ who dwells in thee.",
    "Extremes are for us as if they were not, and as if we were not in regard to them; they escape from us, or we from them.",

    "It is man's natural sickness to believe that he possesses the Truth.",
    "True eloquence scorns eloquence.",
    "Law was once introduced without reason, and has become reasonable.",
    "There are some who speak well and write badly. For the place and the audience warm them, and draw from their minds more than they think of without that warmth.",
    "We feel neither extreme heat nor extreme cold; qualities that are in excess are so much at variance with our feelings that they are impalpable: we do not feel them, though we suffer from their effects.",

    "Reverend Fathers, my letters did not usually follow each other at such close intervals, nor were they so long.... This one would not be so long had I but the leisure to make it shorter.",

    "Rivers are roads that move and carry us whither we wish to go.\n[Fr., Les rivieres sont des chemins qui marchant et qui portent ou l'on veut aller.]",
    "Do they think that they have given us great pleasure by telling us that they hold our soul to be no more than wind or smoke, and saying it moreover in tones of pride and satisfaction? Is this then something to be said gaily? Is it not on the contrary something to be said sadly, as being the saddest thing in the world?",
    "We must know where to doubt, where to feel certain, where to submit. He who does not do so, understands not the force of reason.",
    "I would inquire of reasonable persons whether this principle: Matter is naturally wholly incapable of thought, and this other: I think, therefore I am, are in fact the same in the mind of\nDescartes, and in that of St. Augustine, who said the same thing twelve hundred years before.",
    "There are three means of believing--by inspiration, by reason, and by custom. Christianity, which is the only rational institution, does yet admit none for its sons who do not believe by inspiration. Nor does it injure reason or custom, or debar them of their proper force; on the contrary, it directs us to open our minds by the proofs of the former, and to confirm our minds by the authority of the latter.",
    "In order to enter into a real knowledge of your condition, consider it in this image: A man was cast by a tempest upon an unknown island, the inhabitants of which were in trouble to find\ntheir king, who was lost; and having a strong resemblance both in form and face to this king, he was taken for him, and acknowledged in this capacity by all the people.",
    "Habit is a second nature that destroys the first. But what is nature? Why is habit not natural? I am very much afraid that nature itself is only a first habit, just as habit is a second nature.",
    "What a chimera then is man. What a novelty! What a monster... what a contradiction, what a prodigy",
    "It is of dangerous consequence to represent to man how near he is to the level of beasts, without showing him at the same time his greatness. It is likewise dangerous to let him see his greatness without his meanness. It is more dangerous yet to leave him ignorant of either; but very beneficial that he should be made sensible of both.",
    "Nobody is publicly accepted as an expert on poetry unless he displays the sign of poet, mathematician, etc., but universal men want no sign and make hardly any distinction between the crafts of poet and embroiderer. Universal men are not called poets or mathematicians, etc. But they are all these things and judges of them too. No one could guess what they are, and they will talk about whatever was being talked about when they came in. One quality is not more noticeable in them than another, unless it becomes necessary to put it into practice, and then we remember it.",
    "The philosophers talk to you about the dignity of man, and they tempt you to pride, or they talk to you about the misery of man, and they tempt you to despair.",

    "All who say the same things do not possess them in the same manner; and hence the incomparable author of the Art of Conversation pauses with so much care to make it understood that we must not judge of the capacity of a man by the excellence of a happy remark that we heard him make. Let us penetrate, says he, the mind from which it proceeds. It will oftenest be seen that he will be made to disavow it on the spot, and will be drawn very far from this better thought in which he does not believe, to plunge himself into another, quite base and ridiculous.",
    "There are hardly any truths upon which we always remain agreed, and still fewer objects of pleasure which we do not change every hour, I do not know whether there is a means of giving fixed\nrules for adapting discourse to the inconstancy of our caprices.",
    "Contradiction is not a sign of falsity, nor the lack of contradiction a sign of truth.",
    "People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come in to the mind of others.",
    "What is it, in your opinion, to be a great nobleman? It is to be master of several objects that men covet, and thus to be able to satisfy the wants and the desires of many. It is these\nwants and these desires that attract them towards you, and that make them submit to you: were it not for these, they would not even look at you; but they hope, by these services... to obtain\nfrom you some part of the good which they desire, and of which they see that you have the disposal.",
    "You are in the same manner surrounded with a small circle of persons... full of desire. They demand of you the benefits of desire... You are therefore properly the king of desire. ...equal\nin this to the greatest kings of the earth... It is desire that constitutes their power; that is, the possession of things that men covet.",
    "The method of not erring is sought by all the world. The logicians profess to guide it, the geometricians alone attain it, and apart from science, and the imitations of it, there are no\ntrue demonstrations.",
    "The arithmetical machine produces effects that approach nearer to thought than all the actions of animals. But it does nothing that would enable us to attribute will to it, as to the animals.",
    "Those who write against vanity want the glory of having written well, and their readers the glory of reading well, and I who write this have the same desire, as perhaps those who read this have also.",

    "Le silence e  ternel de ces espaces infinis m'effraie. The eternal silence of these infinite spaces fills me with dread.",
    "Man's greatness is great in that he knows himself wretched. A tree does not know itself wretched. It is then being wretched to know oneself wretched; but it is being great to know that one is wretched.",
    "We do not rest satisfied with the present.... So imprudent we are that we wander in the times which are not ours and do not thinkof the only one which belongs to us; and so idle are we that we dream of those times which are no more and thoughtlessly overlook that which alone exists. For the present is generally painful to us.",
    "According to the doctrine of chance, you ought to put yourself to the trouble of searching for the truth; for if you die without worshiping the True Cause, you are lost. \"But,\" say you, \"if He had wished me to worship Him, He would have left me signs of His will.\" He has done so; but you neglect them. Seek them, therefore; it is well worth it.",
    "Those great efforts of intellect, upon which the mind sometimes touches, are such that it cannot maintain itself there. It only leaps to them, not as upon a throne, forever, but merely for an instant.",
    "Caesar was too old, it seems to me, to go off and amuse himself conquering the world. Such a pastime was all right for Augustus and Alexander; they were young men, not easily held in check, but Caesar ought to have been more mature.",
    "True eloquence makes light of eloquence, true morality makes light of morality; that is to say, the morality of the judgment, which has no rules, makes light of the morality of the intellect.... To make light of philosophy is to be a true philosopher.",
    "Nothing is more dastardly than to act with bravado toward God.",
    "Since [man] is infinitely removed from comprehending the extremes, the end of things and their beginning are hopelessly hidden from him in an impenetrable secret; he is equally incapable of seeing the nothing from which he was made, and the infinite in which he is swallowed up.",
    "Let man then contemplate nature in full and lofty majesty, and turn his eyes away from the mean objects which surround him. Let him look at the dazzling light hung aloft as an eternal lamp to lighten the universe; let him behold the earth, a mere dot compared with the vast circuit which that orb describes, and stand amazed to find that the vast circuit itself is but a very fine point compared with the orbit traced by the starts as they roll their course on high.",
    "What matters it that man should have a little more knowledge of the universe? If he has it, he gets little higher. Is he not always infinitely removed from the end, and is not the duration of our life equally removed from eternity, even if it lasts ten years longer?",
    "Knowledge has two extremes. The first is the pure natural ignorance in which all men find themselves at birth. The other extreme is that reached by great minds, who, having run through all that men can know, find they know nothing, and come back again to that same natural ignorance from which they set out; this is a learned ignorance which is conscious of itself.",

    "All this visible world is but an imperceptible point in the ample bosom of nature.",
    "I take it as a matter not to be disputed, that if all knew what each said of the other, there would not be four friends in the world. This seems proved by the quarrels and disputes caused by the disclosures which are occasionally made.",
    "When malice has reason on its side, it looks forth bravely, and displays that reason in all its luster. When austerity and self-denial have not realized true happiness, and the soul returns to the dictates of nature, the reaction is fearfully extravagant.",
    "Admiration spoils all from infancy.",
    "I cannot judge my work while I am doing it. I have to do as painters do, stand back and view it from a distance, but not too great a distance. How great? Guess.",

    "I should not be a Christian but for the miracles.",
    "Do you wish people to speak well of you? Then do not speak at all yourself.",
    "Man is full of desires: he loves only those who can satisfy them all. \"This man is a good mathematician,\" someone will say.

I need, that is to say, a decent man who can accommodate himself to all my desires in a general sort of way.",
    "Without the knowledge of our wretchedness, the knowledge of God creates pride. With it, the knowledge of God creates despair. The knowledge of Christ offers a third way, because in him we find both God and our wretchedness.",
    "Vanity is illustrated in the cause and effect of love, as in the case of Cleopatra.",
    "For as old age is that period of life most remote from infancy, who does not see that old age in this universal man ought not to be sought in the times nearest his birth, but in those most\n remote from it?",
    "Let us now speak according to natural lights. If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible. . . . We are then incapable of knowing of either what He is or if He is. . . .",

Judge of all things, yet an imbecile earthworm; depository of truth, yet a sewer of uncertainty and error; pride and refuse of the universe. Who shall resolve this tangle?",
    "If we submit everything to reason our religion will be left with nothing mysterious or supernatural. If we offend the principles of reason our religion will be absurd and ridiculous . . . There are two equally dangerous extremes: to exclude reason, to admit nothing but reason.",
    "Just as I do not know where I came from, so I do not know where I am going. All I know is that when I leave this world I shall fall forever into oblivion, or into the hands of an angry God, without knowing which of the two will be my lot for eternity. Such is my state of mind, full of weakness and uncertainty. The only conclusion I can draw from all this is that I must pass my days without a thought of trying to find out what is going to happen to me.",

    "Those who are accustomed to judge by feeling do not understand the process of reasoning, because they want to comprehend at a glance and are not used to seeking for first principles. Those, on the other hand, who are accustomed to reason from first principles do not understand matters of feeling at all, because they look for first principles and are unable to comprehend at a glance.",
    "How vain painting is-we admire the realistic depiction of objects which in their original state we don't admire at all.",

    "The Stoics say, \"Retire within yourselves; it is there you will find your rest.\" And that is not true. Others say, \"Go out of yourselves; seek happiness in amusement.\" And this is not true.

    "It is an appalling thing to feel all one possesses drain away.",
    "All the dignity of man consists in thought. Thought is therefore by its nature a wonderful and incomparable thing. It must have strange defects to be contemptible. But it has such, so that nothing is more ridiculous. How great it is in its nature! How vile it is in its defects! But what is this thought? How foolish it is!",
    "When I consider the small span of my life absorbed in the eternity of all time, or the small part of space which I can touch or see engulfed by the infinite immensity of spaces that I know not and that know me not, I am frightened and astonished to see myself here instead of there â€¦ now instead of then.",

    "Evil is easily discovered; there is an infinite variety; good is almost unique. But some kinds of evil are almost as difficult to discover as that which we call good; and often particular evil of this class passes for good.

    "Human life is thus only a perpetual illusion; men deceive and flatter each other. No one speaks of us in our presence as he does of us in our absence. Human society is founded on mutual deceit; few friendships would endure if each knew what his friend said of him in his absence, although he then spoke in sincerity and without passion.",

    "You see, if the height of the mercury [barometer] column is less on the top of a mountain than at the foot of it (as I have many reasons for believing, although everyone who has so far written about it is of the contrary opinion), it follows that the weight of the air must be the sole cause of the phenomenon, and not that abhorrence of a vacuum, since it is obvious that at the foot of the mountain there is more air to have weight than at the summit, and we cannot possibly say that the air at the foot of the mountain has a greater aversion to empty space than at the top.",
    "Let man then contemplate the whole of nature in her full and grand majesty... No idea approaches it.

    "One-half of life is admitted by us to be passed in sleep, in which, however, it may appear otherwise, we have no perception of truth, and all our feelings are delusions; who knows but the other half of life, in which we think we are awake, is a sleep also, but in some respects different from the other, and from which we wake when we, as we call it, sleep.

    "Let a man choose what condition he will, and let him accumulate around him all the goods and gratifications seemingly calculated to make him happy in it; if that man is left at any time without occupation or amusement, and reflects on what he is, the meagre, languid felicity of his present lot will not bear him up. He will turn necessarily to gloomy anticipations of the future; and unless his occupation calls him out of himself, he is inevitably wretched.",
