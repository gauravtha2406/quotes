    "I was not the one to invent lies: they were created in a society divided by class and each of us inherited lies when we were born. It is not by refusing to lie that we will abolish lies: it is by eradicating class by any means necessary.",
    "Is there really nothing, nothing left of me?",
    "Everything that exists is born for no reason, carries on living through weakness, and dies by accident",
    "I exist. It's sweet, so sweet, so slow. And light: you'd think it floated all by itself. It stirs. It brushes by me, melts and vanishes. Gently, gently. There is bubbling water in my mouth. I swallow. It slides down my throat, it caresses me — and now it comes up again into my mouth. For ever I shall have a little pool of whitish water in my mouth - lying low - grazing my tongue. And this pool is still me. And the tongue. And the throat is me.",
    "You know how much I admire Che Guevara. In fact, I believe that the man was not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age: as a fighter and as a man, as a\n theoretician who was able to further the cause of revolution by drawing his theories from his personal experience in battle.",
    "I said to myself, 'I want to die decently'.",
    "If I relegate impossible Salvation to the prop room, what remains? A whole man, composed of all men and as good as all of them and no better than any.",
    "I have crossed the seas, I have left cities behind me, and I have followed the source of rivers towards their source or plunged into forests, always making for other cities. I have had women, I have fought with men ; and I could never turn back any more than a record can spin in reverse. And all that was leading me where ? To this very moment.",
    "Fear? If I have gained anything by damning myself, it is that I no longer have anything to fear.",
    "A madman's ravings are absurd in relation to the situation in which he finds himself, but not in relation to his madness.",

    "I committed the first crime by creating men as mortals. After that, what more could you do, you the murderers? Come on; they already had death in them: at most you simply hastened things a little.",
    "The plight of modern man is that he is condemmed to be free.",
    "Time is too large, it can't be filled up. Everything you plunge into it is stretched and disintegrates.",
    "All I want is' - and he uttered the final words through clenched teeth and with a sort of shame - 'to retain my freedom.' I should myself have thought,' said Jacques, 'that freedom consisted in frankly confronting situations into which one had deliberately entered, and accepting all one's responsibilities. But that, no doubt, is not your view.",
    "And I too wanted to be. That is all I wanted; and this is the last word. At the bottom of all these attempts which seemed without bounds, I find the same desire again: to drive existence out of me, to rid the passing moments of their fat, to twist them, dry them, purify myself, harden myself, to give back at last the sharp, precise sound of a saxophone note. That could even make an apologue: there was a poor man who got in the wrong world.",
    "Absurd, irreducible; nothing — not even a profound and secret delirium of nature — could explain it. Obviously I did not know everything, I had not seen the seeds sprout, or the tree grow. But faced with this great wrinkled paw, neither ignorance nor knowledge was important: the world of explanations and reasons is not the world of existence. A circle is not absurd, it is clearly explained by the rotation of a straight segment around one of its extremities. But neither does a circle exist. This root, on the other hand, existed in such a way that I could not explain it.",
    "There is no salvation anywhere. The idea of salvation implies the idea of an absolute.",
    "Everything is gratuitous, this garden, this city and myself. When you suddenly realize it, it makes you feel sick and everything begins to drift . . . that's nausea.",
    "As if there could be true stories: things happen in one way, and we retell them in the opposite way.",
    "The sun is not ridiculous, quite the contrary. On everything I like, on the rust of the construction girders, on the rotten boards of the fence, a miserly, uncertain light falls, like the look you give, after a sleepless night, on decisions made with enthusiasm the day before, on pages you have written in one spurt without crossing out a word.",
    "It answers the question that was tormenting you: my love, you are not 'one thing in my life' - not even the most important - because my life no longer belongs to me because...you are always me.",

    "She suffers as a miser. She must be miserly with her pleasures, as well. I wonder if sometimes she doesn't wish she were free of this monotonous sorrow, of these mutterings which start as soon as she stops singing, if she doesn't wish to suffer once and for all, to drown herself in despair. In any case, it would be impossible for her: she is bound.",
    "Existence is an imperfection.",
    "Like morality, literature needs to be universal. So that the writer must put himself on the side of the majority, of the two billion starving, if he wishes to be able to speak to all and be read by all. Failing that, he is at the service of a privileged class and, like it, an exploiter.",
    "I wanted the moments of my life to follow and order themselves like those of a life remembered. You might as well try and catch time by the tail.",
    "Torture is senseless violence, born in fear... torture costs human lives but does not save them. We would almost be too lucky if these crimes were the work of savages: the truth is that torture makes torturers.",

    "What is not possible is not to choose.",
    "I maintain that inversion is the effect of neither a prenatal choice nor an endocrinal malformation nor even the passive and determined result of complexes. It is an outlet that a child discovers when he is suffocating.",

    "emotion is first of all and in principle an accident",
    "I grow warm, I begin to feel happy. There is nothing extraordinary in this, it is a small happiness of Nausea: it spreads at the bottom of the viscous puddle, at the bottom of out time - the time of purple suspenders, and broken chair seats; it is made of white, soft instants, spreading at the edge, like an oil stain. No sooner than born, it is already old, it seems as though I have known it for twenty years.",

    "As long as the writer cannot write for the two billion men who are hungry, he will be oppressed by a feeling of malaise.",
    "But I must finally realize that I am subject to these sudden transformations. The thing is that I rarely think; a crowd of small metamorphoses accumulate in me without my noticing it, and then, one fine day, a veritable revolution takes place.",
    "It's just what people do when they're getting old, when they're sick of themselves and their life; they think of money and take care of themselves.",

    "Man's existence precedes his essence",
    "I admire [Samuel] Beckett, but I am totally against him. He seeks no improvement.",
    "Anything, anything would be better than this agony of mind, this creeping pain that gnaws and fumbles and caresses one and never hurts quite enough.",
    "I am finishing a biography of [Gustave] Flaubert. Because he is the opposite of what I am. One needs to rub up against argument.",
    "What I see is teeming cohesion, contained dispersal... For him, to sculpt is to take the fat off space.",
    "Then I realized what separated us: what I thought about him could not reach him; it was psychology, the kind they write about in books. But his judgment went through me like a sword and questioned my very right to exist. And it was true, I had always realized it; I hadn't the right to exist. I had appeared by chance, I existed like a stone, a plant or a microbe. My life put out feelers towards small pleasures in every direction. Sometimes it sent out vague signals; at other times I felt nothing more than a harmless buzzing.",
    "So it comes to this; one doesn’t need rest. Why bother about sleep if one isn’t sleepy? That stands to reason, doesn’t it? Wait a minute, there’s a snag somewhere; something disagreeable. Why, now, should it be disagreeable? …Ah, I see; it’s life without a break.",
    "When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.",
    "I am alone in this white, garden-rimmed street. Alone and free. But this freedom is rather like death.",
    "It is too early to love. We will buy the right to do so by shedding blood.",
    "In Guinea I could read [Franz] Kafka. I re-discover in him my own discomfort.",
    "One always dies too soon or too late. And yet, life is there, finished: the line is drawn, and it must all be added up. You are nothing other than your life.",
    "An individual chooses and makes himself.",
    "[Andre] Gide can say it to me: it is a writer's morality only addressed to a few privileged\npeople. For that reason it no longer interests me.",
    "Existence is prior to essence.",
    "I clung to nothing, in a way I was calm. But it was a horrible calm—because of my body; my body, I saw with its eyes, I heard with its ears, but it was no longer me; it sweated and trembled by itself and I didn’t recognize it any more.",
    "From the period when I wrote La Nausea I wanted to create a morality. My evolution consists in my no longer dreaming of doing so.",
    "Existence precedes and rules essence.",
    "I have always been an optimist, perhaps even too much.",
    "I am myself and I am here.",
    "I must be without remorse or regrets as I am without excuse; for from the instant of my upsurge into being, I carry the weight of the world by myself alone without help, engaged in a world for which I bear the whole responsibility without being able, whatever I do, to tear myself away from this responsibility for an instant.",
    "That of War and Peace or of Almagestes. All are satisfactory. The only criterion of a work\nis its validity: that it should grip and that it should last.",
    "First all men must be able to become men by the improvement of their conditions of existence, so that a universal morality can be created. If I begin by saying to them: \"Thou\nshalt not lie,\" there is no longer any possibility of political action. What matters first is the liberation of man.",
    "The public, too, has to make an effort in order to understand the writer who, though he renounce complacent obscurity, cannot always express his new-hidden thoughts lucidly and according to accepted models.",
    "For forty years I was conscripted by the absolute, the neurosis. The absolute is gone. There remain countless tasks among which literature is in no way privileged.",
    "Existence is not something which lets itself be thought of form a distance; it must invade you suddenly, master you, weigh heavily on your heart like a great motionless beast - or else there is nothing at all.",
    "You see, I'm fond of teasing, it's a second nature with me—and I'm used to teasing myself. Plaguing myself, if you prefer; I don't tease nicely.",
    "To choose this or that is to affirm at the same time the value of what we choose, because we can never choose evil. We always choose the good, and nothing can be good for us without being\n good for all.",
    "We do not wish to say only that a man is responsible for his own individuality, but that he is responsible for that of all men.",

    "All-powerful god, who am I but the fear that I inspire in others?",
    "The For-itself, in fact, is nothing but the pure nihilation of the In-itself; it is like a hole of being at the heart of Being.",
    "You see, the contemporary writer must write through his intimations of unease, while trying to elucidate them.",
    "Love or hatred calls for self-surrender. He cuts a fine figure, the warm-blooded, prosperous man, solidly entrenched in his well-being, who one fine day surrenders all to love—or to hatred; himself, his house, his land, his memories.",

    "Things are entirely what they appear to be and behind them... there is nothing.",
    "Thrown into the atmosphere of action [in 1954], I suddenly understood the kind of neurosis that dominated all my previous work. I had not been able to recognize it before: I was inside. Simone de Beauvoir had guessed these reasons before I did.",
    "In a country lacking leaders, in Africa, for instance, how could a native educated in Europe refuse to become a professor, even at the price of his literary vocation?",
    "One could only damage oneself through the harm one did to others. One could never get directly at oneself.",

    "This then is the age of reason.",
    "To eat is to appropriate by destruction.",
    "Abjection is a methodological conversion, like Cartesian doubt and Husserlian epoche: it establishes the world as a closed system which consciousness regards from without, in the manner of divine understanding.",
    "Happiness has to be installed in each person as a state of affairs completely cut off from the process that brought it about and, in particular, from the real situation. Man has to be affected with happiness. It is a tonality given to him. Contradiction: if one does take care to give him happiness, it is because he is a free creature--but in order to give it to him, one turns him into an object.",
    "To love is never just to love since it is also to will to love, and ... to love in spite of oneself, to allow oneself to be overcome by one's love.",
    "Absurd, irreducible; nothing--not even a profound and secret delirium of nature--could explain [a tree root].",
    "In the nineteenth century one had to give all sorts of guarantees and lead an exemplary life in order to cleanse oneself in the eyes of the bourgeois of the sin of writing, for literature is, in essence, heresy. The situation has not changed except that it is now the Communists, that is, the qualified representatives of the proletariat, who as a matter of principle regard the writer as suspect.",
    "My eyes feel all soft, all soft as flesh. I'm going to sleep.",
    "I’ve dropped out of their hearts like a little sparrow fallen from its nest. So gather me up, dear, fold me to your heart – and you’ll see how nice I can be.",
    "For common minds have an ugly ability to perceive in the deepest and richest saying nothing but their own everyday opinion.",
    "God is the solitude of men. There was only me: I alone decided to commit Evil; alone, I invented Good. I am the one who cheated, I am the one who performed miracles, I am the one accusing myself today, I alone can absolve myself; me, the man.",
    "In any case, if you ever leave me with a handsome man, do not tell me that you trust me because, let me warn you: that is not what will prevent me from deceiving you, if I want to. On the contrary.",

    "Heroism is not to be won at the point of a pen.",
    "The painful secret of gods and kings is that men are free, Aegistheus. You know it and they do not.",
    "Remember, Orestes: you were part of my herd, you grazed in the fields along with my sheep. Your liberty is nothing but a mange eating away at you, it is nothing but an exile.",
    "I consider Les Nourritures Terrestres as a frightening book: \"Look for God in no other place than everywhere.\" Go and tell that to a workman, an engineer!",
    "I am neither virgin nor priest enough to play with the inner life.",
    "Many young people today do not concern themselves with style. They think that what one says should be said simply and that is all. For me, style - which does not exclude simplicity, quite the opposite - is above all a way of saying three or four things in one. There is the simple sentence, with its immediate meaning, and then at the same time, below this immediate meaning, other meanings are organized. If one is not capable of giving language this plurality of meaning, then it is not worth the trouble to write.",
    "There is no book of mine that I reject. That does not mean that I find them good.",
    "A pale reflection of myself wavers in my consciousness...and suddenly the “I” pales, pales, and fades out.",
    "Night is falling: at dusk, you must have good eyesight to be able to tell the Good Lord from the Devil.",
    "I do not give a damn about the dead. They died for the [Communist] Party and the Party can decide what it wants. I practice a live man's politics, for the living.",
    "If you begin by saying, 'Thou shalt not lie,' there is no longer any possibility of political action.",
    "Nicias, do you think you can erase with good deeds the wrongs you committed against your mother? What good deed will ever reach her? Her soul is a scorching noon time, without a single breath of a breeze, nothing moves, nothing changes, nothing lives there; a great emaciated sun, an immobile sun eternally consumes her.",
    "It is not right, my fellow-countrymen, you who know very well all the crimes committed in our name. It's not at all right that you do not breathe a word about them to anyone, not even to your own soul, for fear of having to stand in judgment of yourself. I am willing to believe that at the beginning you did not realize what was happening; later, you doubted whether such things could be true; but now you know, and still you hold your tongues.",
    "Life is a useless passion.",
    "Man is always a wizard to man, and the social world is at first magical.",
    "When my relations with the Communist Party gave me the necessary perspective I decided to write my autobiography. I wanted to show how a man can pass from literature held sacred to action which nevertheless remains that of an intellectual.",
    "I had dreamed my life for nearly fifty years (I am about to be fifty-nine). But, you see,\nthere are two tones in Les Mats: the echo of this condemnation and a mitigation of that severity.",

    "I was a neophyte in another world [in 1954].",
    "I was escaping from Nature and at last becoming myself, that Other whom I was aspiring to be in the eyes of others.",
    "On my way to the office in the morning, there are, in front of me, behind me, other men going to their jobs. I see them; if I dared, I would smile at them. I think to myself that I am a socialist, that they are the purpose of my life, of my efforts and that they do not know it yet.",
    "Il n'y a pas d'autre univers qu'un univers humain, l'univers de la subjectivite   humaine. There is no other universe except the human universe, the universe of human subjectivity.",

    "Never have I thought that I was the happy possessor of a \"talent;\" my sole concern has been to save myself by work and faith.",
    "The [Communist] Party has one objective: the creation of a socialist economy; and one means: the utilization of the class struggle.",
    "L'homme est une passion inutile. Man is a useless passion.",
    "What do you want to do with the [Communist] Party? A racing stable? What good is it to sharpen a knife every day if you never useit for slicing? A party is never more than a means. There is only one objective: power.",
    "Perception is naturally surpassed toward action; better yet, it can be revealed only in and through projects of action. The world is revealed as an \"always future hollow\", for we are always future to ourselves.",
    "It is the same: a chosen one is a man whom God's finger crushes against the wall.",
    "But for me there is neither Monday nor Sunday: there are days which pass in disorder, and then, sudden lightning like this one. Nothing has changed and yet everything is different. I can't describe it, it's like the Nausea and yet it's just the opposite: at last an adventure happens to me and when I question myself I see that it happens that I am myself and that I am here; I am the one who splits in the night, I am as happy as the hero of a novel.",
    "I had been playing with matches and burned a small rug. I was in the process of covering up my crime when suddenly God saw me. I felt His gaze inside my head and on my hands....I flew into a rage against so crude an indiscretion, I blasphemed....He never looked at me again....I had the more difficulty getting rid of Him the Holy Ghost in that He had installed Himself at the back of my head....I collared the Holy Ghost in the cellar and threw Him out.",
    "Generally speaking there is no irreducible taste or inclination. They all represent a certain appropriative choice of being. It is up to existential psychoanalysis to compare and classify\nthem. Ontology abandons us here; it has merely enabled us to determine the ultimate ends of human reality, its fundamental possibilities, and the value which haunts it.",
    "Man is always separated from what he is by all the breadth of the being which he is not. He makes himself known to himself from the other side of the world and he looks from the horizon\n toward himself to recover his inner being.",
    "I have nothing but contempt for you idiotic chosen ones who have the heart to rejoice when there are the damned in Hell and the poor on earth; as for me, I am on the side of men and I will not leave it.",
    "The appearance of the other in the world corresponds therefore to a congealed sliding of the whole universe.",
    "Good digestions, the gray monotony of provincial life, and the boredom-ah the soul-destroying boredom-of long days of mild content.",
    "At times discreetly, at times disgustingly, I yielded to the most fatal temptation whenever I could no longer bear it: as a result of impatience, Orpheus lost Eurydice; as a result of impatience, I lost myself.",
    "Once liberty has exploded in the soul of a man, the gods can do nothing against that man.",
    "All the same, they [books] do serve some purpose. Culture doesn't save anything or anyone, it doesn't justify. But it's a product of man: he projects himself into it, he recognizes himself in it; that critical mirror alone offers him his image.",
    "Man exists, turns up, appears on the scene and only afterwards, defines himself",
    "Ah! Do not judge the gods, young man, they have painful secrets.",
    "The past is the luxury of proprietors.",
    "Understand me: I wish to be a man from somewhere, a man among men. You see, a slave, when he passes by, weary and surly, carrying a heavy load, limping along and looking down at his feet, only at his feet to avoid falling down; he is in his town, like a leaf in greenery, like a tree in a forest, argos surrounds him, heavy and warm, full of herself; I want to be that slave, Electra, I want to pull the city around me and to roll myself up in it like a blanket. I will not leave.",
    "I wrote in Les Mots that \"I have often thought against myself.\" That sentence has not been\nunderstood either. Critics have seen in it a confession of masochism. But that is how one\nshould think: revolting against everything \"inculcated'' that one may have within oneself.",

    "If you want to deserve Hell, you need only stay in bed. The world is iniquity; if you accept it, you are an accomplice, if you change it you are an executioner.",
    "My thought is me: that's why I can't stop. I exist because I think… and I can't stop myself from thinking. At this very moment - it's frightful - if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing. I am the one who pulls myself from the nothingness to which I aspire.",

    "We must act out passion before we can feel it.",
    "What is meant here by saying that existence precedes essence? It means first of all, man exists, turns up, appears on the scene, and, only afterwards, defines himself. If man, as the existentialist conceives him, is indefinable, it is because at first he is nothing. Only afterward will he be something, and he himself will have made what he will be.",
    "In a word, man must create his own essence: it is in throwing himself into the world, suffering there, struggling there, that he gradually defines himself.",
    "The absurd man will not commit suicide; he wants to live, without relinquishing any of his certainty, without a future, without hope, without illusions … and without resignation either.

These are honest hypotheses which take the facts into account: but I sense so definitely that they come from me, and that they are simply a way of unifying my own knowledge. Not a glimmer comes from Rollebon's side. Slow, lazy, sulky, the facts adapt themselves to the rigour of the order I wish to give them; but it remains outside of them.

    "[M]an is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, in other respect is free; because, once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.

Then there are words, inside the thoughts, unfinished words, a sketchy sentence which constantly returns...It goes, it goes ... and there's no end to it. It's worse than the rest because I feel responsible and have complicity in it. For example, this sort of painful rumination: I exist, I am the one who keeps it up. I.",

    "[Lost of the absolute] is in this sense that ''I no longer know what to do with my life\" must be understood.

    "As for the square at Meknes, where I used to go every day, it's even simpler: I do not see it at all anymore. All that remains is the vague feeling that it was charming, and these five words that are indivisibly bound together: a charming square at Meknes. ... I don't see anything any more: I can search the past in vain, I can only find these scraps of images and I am not sure what they represent, whether they are memories or just fiction.",

But if I listen to a tape recorder, the listening time is determined by the speed at which the tape turns and not by my own needs.",
    "But [your crime] will be there, one hundred times denied, always there, dragging itself behind you. Then you will finally know that you have committed your life with one throw of the die, once and for all, and there is nothing you can do but tug our crime along until your death.

    "Generosity is nothing else than a craze to possess. All which I abandon, all which I give, I enjoy in a higher manner through the fact that I give it away. To give is to enjoy possessively the object which one gives.",
    "I have such a desire to sleep and am so much behind my sleep. A good night, one good night and all this nonsense will be swept away.",
    "Don't you feel the same way? When I cannot see myself, even though I touch myself, I wonder if I really exist.",

    "Man is abandoned on earth in the midst of his infinite responsibilities, without help, with no aim but what he sets himself.",

    "Philosophy appears to some people as a homogenous milieu: there thoughts are born and die, there systems are built, and there, in turn, they collapse.

    "It is always more valuable to report the truth.",
    "We will freedom for freedom’s sake, in and through particular circumstances. And in thus willing freedom, we discover that it depends entirely upon the freedom of others and that the freedom of others depends upon our own. Obviously, freedom as the definition of a man does not depend upon others, but as soon as there is a commitment, I am obliged to will the liberty of others at the same time as my own. I cannot make liberty my aim unless I make that of others equally my aim.",
