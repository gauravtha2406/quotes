Those who decide what news you will or will not hear are paid by, and tolerated purely at the whim of, those who hold economic power. If the parent corporation doesn't want you to know something, it won't be on the news. Period. Or, at the very least, it will be slanted to suit them, and then rarely followed up.",

If you can find a solution to homelessness where the corporations and politicians can make a few million dollars each, you will see the streets of America begin to clear up pretty damn quick!",

And when you suspend your individual beauty you also give up a lot of your humanity. You will do things in the name of a group that you would never do on your own.

    "If you dropped me off a space platform onto the ground where a line was drawn, I would fall to the left side of it. I believe the difference between right and left is that the right, for the most part, the bulk of their philosophy is interested in property, and the rights of people to own property and gain and acquire and keep property. And I think on the left - though they blend and mix - on the left primarily you will find people who are more concerned about humans, and the human condition, and what can be done.",

    "There is a certain amount of righteous indignation I hold for the American culture, because to get back to the real root of it, to get broader about it, my opinion that is my species - and my culture in America specifically - have let me down and betrayed me. I think this species had great, great promise, with this great upper brain that we have, and I think we squandered it on God and Mammon. And I think this culture of ours has such promise, with the promise of real, true freedom, and then everyone has been shackled by ownership and possessions and acquisition and status and power.",

I just began to invent myself early in life, and went out and did something about it.",

    "It's not in the mainstream media yet, but the biggest jump in skin cancer has occurred since the advent of sunscreens. That kind of thing makes me happy. The fact that people, in pursuit of a superficial look of health, give themselves a fatal disease.

I think I have found a detached point of view, an ideal emotional detachment from the American experience and culture and the human experience and culture and human choices.",

And unfortunately, people get sucked into it and then they've got you on the treadmill. You know: ''You've got to have a good job'' and \"You've got to have a good education'' - which is another word for indoctrination.

I feel that if I was figuratively dropped on the Earth and there was a political line, I would be just left of center. The difference for me is that conservatives are more interested in property values and rights and free markets, and liberals are more interested in human rights. In the end, there are people who don't fit into the marketplace and are not equipped. I believe the government should step in where the free market fails.",
    "Primitive societies, or social groupings, had shamans, and some of them even more recent in time. Shamans were tricksters.

    "The first obligation I have is to be funny; it's my first impulse and an instinct. I like being funny and finding the jokes.",
    "My mother and I had a lot of distance between us emotionally, although, on the surface, most of the time, we appeared good and friendly, and all that. But I was a problem. I was a street kid.",
    "Sometimes, when I was really loaded, I'd sit on the floor and sort out every nut and bolt in the house. It was just sheer insanity. And often there'd be speed in the cut, so I was a speed freak, too.",
    "I've just completed a five-year period that can perhaps best be called a breathing spell. A time of getting my health back and gathering my strength. That time also included incredible cocaine abuse, a heart attack and my wife's recovery from both alcoholism and cocaine abuse.",
    "There was a built-in audience for the rebel in me that had been all along not expressing himself.",
    "No one has to come see my shows who doesn't like me talking about white Christians. They are free not buy a ticket. They're free to leave at any time. So I'm not imposing anything on anyone. Therefore I feel free to cross the line.",
    "One of the interesting things about \"outsidership\" is that underneath it there's a longing to belong. I just wish the thing I refused to belong to - the species, Western capital culture - was a little more respectable. My one true relaxation is my flotation tank, in which I can either meditate or just drift off.",
    "Self-expression is a hallmark of an artist, of art, to get something off one's chest, to sing one's song. So that element is present in all art. It is the key to even standing up and saying, \"Hey, listen to me.\" Self-expression can be based on looking at the world and making observations about it.",
    "The secretiveness. The stealth. Those were obviously the aspects of cocaine use I was addicted to.",
    "You know, if a drug has anything going for it at all, it should be self-limiting. It should tell you when you've had enough. Acid and peyote were that way for me.",
    "I think it would be fair and right to use some of my land and wealth for a drug-rehab center or an Indian school.",
    "When people asked me, \"Do you get high to go onstage?\" I could never understand the question. I mean, I'd been high since eight that morning.",
    "I should think it takes a fairly low intellect to draw pleasure from the following activity: hitting a ball with a crooked stick. and then walking after it! An then ..hitting it again!",
    "I use the [vulgar] words because apparently these words do not corrupt morally. I'm from the street in New York, hung around in a tough neighborhood. It was common to curse, you make your point. It's a very effective language. I try not to overdo it. It's never to shock. I know where it fits, it's never to shock. There's no shock value left in words.",
    "I just love it when I hear a little commotion, someone leaving. When I see those doors in the back . . .",
    "I don't believe there's any problem in this country, no matter how tough it is, that Americans, when they roll up their sleeves, can't completely ignore.",
    "The base of evil in the world is religion of any kind",
    "It seems to me like a perversion of talent for an artist of any kind to further the corporate structure of America or the personal interests of the morons and thieves who run it.",
    "I think of myself as an entertainer: I'm a performing entertainer, I'm a stand-up comic. But there's an artist at work here, too. One who interprets his world through his own filter.",
    "I literally didn't know my father. My mother had been a secretary, and after she and my father split, she went back to work for an advertising executive. So my older brother and I were \"latch-door kids.\" We went home for lunch and after school by ourselves.",
    "When I see a large group of people, I wonder how many of them will eventually require autopsies.",
    "We created god in our own image and likeness!",
    "In adolescence you have to separate yourself and establish your identity. So, being very independent anyway, I took charge.",
    "I feel sorry for confetti. Its useful life lasts about two seconds. And it can never be used again.",
    "I believe myself to be a worthwhile and inventive performer in my own right. But I'm not in a league with Lenny [Bruce], certainly not in terms of social commentary.",
    "I went to my old school, where all the kids I'd been with for eight years were about to graduate. But the sisters wanted me to repeat the whole term; so I went to the principal and pleaded with her to allow me to graduate with my class. She finally agreed on the condition that I write the graduation play. It was called How Do You Spend Your Leisure Time?Catchy title, huh?",
    "Once the high priests and the traders took over, we were lost as a species.",
    "I believe you can joke about anything.",
    "The enjoyment has been diminishing. Now, there's no question that it's sort of fun to get high.",
    "The angles of my body show you an awful lot. I started doing coke to feel open, but by that time, the hole had opened so wide that I'd fallen through. The body language in those photos tells you everything.",
    "The coke made me incredibly horny.",
    "When I'm not actually doing my work, I'm planning it or thinking about it or reading things that on some level are transformed into performance fantasies. I have no active interests.",
    "The dividend I get [from my compulsion] is the freedom to be totally disorderly in my dreamworld.",
    "I was a class clown, of the classic term for it. I would get the work done easily, and then I would try to deprive other people of their educations. I developed skills for mimicry, and I was a good showoff. I knew how to get attention, and I knew how to do it in a positive funny way.",
    "Language always gives you away.",
    "There are no bad words. Bad thoughts. Bad intentions, and wooooords.",
    "Whereas your blackness, ethnicity, homosexuality is something that might be genetic, I can't touch that, and I have no right.",
    "Besides the drugs and counterculture, I started talking about myself, which is the first thing you do when you are a writer.",
    "And this should go without saying. That's why I'm going to say it: Drinking and driving don't mix. Do your drinking early in the morning and get it out of the way. Then go driving while the visibility is still good.",
    "I try not to see new comics - their acts or their films. Part of that is professional. I don't want to be influenced. But another part is fear and jealousy. I'm afraid to see how good they might be. I don't like that emotion, but it's part of me.",
    "The two big mistakes were the belief in a sky god - that there's a man in the sky with 10 things he doesn't want you to do and you'll burn for a long time if you do them - and private property, which I think is at the core of our failure as a species. That's the source of my indignations, my dissatisfactions, however it comes out on the stage. I feel betrayed by the people I'm part of, these creatures, these magnificent creatures.",
    "Leadership camp? Isn't that where Hitler went?",
    "When I first heard the song Don't worry - be happy I realized it was exactly the kind of mindless philosophy that Americans would respond to. It would make a great national anthem along with Me first.",
    "The best thing about living at the water's edge: You only have assholes on three sides of you, and if they come this way you can hear them splash.",
    "I always wanted and enjoyed sex, but I never put much importance on scoring or having an athletic sex life. I guess I define myself more by my career and my commitment to a relationship than by my ability to have a lot of chicks or achieve ten orgasms in an evening.",
    "Don Ho can sign autographs 3.4 times faster than Efrem Zimbalist Jr.",
    "My father? My father left when I was quite young. Well actually, he was asked to leave. He had trouble metabolizing alcohol.",
    "In football the object is to march into enemy territory and cross his goal. In baseball the object is to go home.",
    "Don't take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, to the next county, to a foreign country, but NOT to where the guilt is.",
    "I tell ya, if I hadn't chosen the career of being a performer, I think linguistics would have been a natural area that I'd have loved - to teach it, probably, Language has always fascinated me. There's a genetic inheritance there a good language gene, which I inherited [from my mother and grandfather] and she fostered that in me as he fostered that in her.",
    "And, of course, the funniest food: \"kumquats\". I don't even bring them home anymore. I sit there laughing and they go to waste.",
    "Catholic school gave me the tools to reject the very religion they wanted me to have. They taught me how to think for myself and to be independent.",
    "I'm a believer that things happen. Fate is what happens.",
    "I think there's a little more attention to human needs than to property rights. But I don't think much of political activism. It's so shortsighted. Most people are interested in their own personal comfort. I've said that about environmentalists. I think they care about bike paths and places to park their Volvos, not the planet as an abstraction.",
    "I just try to find targets I feel something about and express it my way.",
    "The only good thing about religion is the music. Because nature is filled with balances and opposites, there are always exceptions to the overall rules, whether the overall rules are bleak or otherwise. If you propound a joyous theory of existence, I will find an exception to that. If I propound a bleak theory, someone will find a joyous exception. That's just nature being nature, I think, and I don't think it offers a lot of hope. It's sort of a respite along the way.",
    "Somehow I enjoy watching people suffer.",
    "The ending of my experience with cocaine came in a periodic way. I would get high less frequently, I would use smaller amounts, and I would do coke for less periods of time. And that process just kept increasing and increasing until I wasn't using it at all. I didn't go on a program anywhere. I didn't join an organization or detox anywhere. I just slowly tapered off until it was gone. That was also true of my heavy pot use. I just tapered off until there was almost no use at all. And the same thing was true of drinking tons of beer.",
    "I'd say pot has been a break-even proposition for me.",
    "You live eighty years, and at best you get about six minutes of pure magic.",
    "Anyone who's onstage is going to attract a certain number of misguided people. But I was never very interested in groupies.",
    "On Thanksgiving, you realize you're living in a modern world. Millions of turkeys baste themselves in millions of ovens that clean themselves.",
    "Anyone who's onstage is going to attract a certain number of misguided people. But I was never very interested in groupies. Instead of thinking about the sex, I'd always think about the clap and the crabs those people have.",
    "If a drug has anything going for it at all, it should be self-limiting. It should tell you when you've had enough.",
    "Two things happened. The creative side of my career was harmed. When I'd sit down and write under the influence of coke, the ratio of pages kept to pages thrown out declined drastically. But onstage, when rapping about a feeling I already owned, I would sometimes get a burst of eloquence.",
    "When you're high, it's easy to kid yourself about how clever certain mediocre pieces of material are.",
    "To me, smoking pot meant sitting with a newspaper on my legs, rolling the seeds down, pulling the twigs out and finally producing a perfectly cylindrical, absolutely wonderful joint that you either locked at both ends or pinched off, or pinched at one end and left open at the other.",
    "I went to George Washington High School for six months before my 16th birthday, when I could legally quit. That was an even worse experience than the Catholic schools. I mean, they were still teaching fractions. But mostly, I played hooky.",
    "Broadway isn't a very big career move. There's no money in it and it doesn't mean anything to your career. It's just a nice little jewel in the crown.",
    "When I got out of high school they retired my jersey, but it was for hygiene and sanitary reasons.",
    "I don`t understand a belief that there is an invisible being in the sky who watches over us all the time and keeps score and who throws you in a burning pit. I think that's very limiting, very antihuman. It's the way they devised for helping to control people because if they can make you believe in an invisible man who's going to hurt you later, they can make you believe anything!",
    "Mother's milk leads to everything.",
    "I like to write without being stoned. I like to have a hit or two and then go punch up the writing. I just see different things and hear different things. But it's nice to be working from the base that I wrote originally and then come to it with a little buzz. I can have a little wine from time to time. I have a hit from time to time, but those are the only things I do.",
    "Barry Goldwater has definitely decided to be a candidate in '64. He will campaign in all thirteen states.",
    "The ritual was very important to me: cleaning the pot, rolling the pot.",

    "Baseball is a nineteenth-century pastoral game. Football is a twentieth-century technological struggle.",
    "The mayfly lives only one day. And sometimes it rains.",
    "If a piece requires some specific inflection, I'll record it. I take a lot of notes, and later categorize them, combining them alongside existing ideas, and eventually put a piece together.",
    "I think self-expression is present at all times, and whether or not you're talking about the outside world or your responses to it depends on the moment and the subject.",
    "If two baseball players from the same hometown, on different teams, receive the same uniform number, it is not ironic. It is a coincidence. If Barry Bonds attains lifetime statistics identical to his father's, it will not be ironic. It will be a coincidence.",
    "Baseball is the only major sport that appears backwards in a mirror.",
    "Did you ever look at your watch, and you look away... and you don't know what time it is?",
    "There are women named Faith, Hope, Joy, and Prudence. Why not Despair, Guilt, Rage, and Grief? It seems only right. 'Tom, I'd like you to meet the girl of my dreams, Tragedy.' These days, Trajedi.",

    "He is dead now, but he meant well.",
    "Sun worship is fairly simple. There's no mystery, no miracles, no pageantry, no one asks for money, there are no songs to learn, and we don't have a special building where we all gather once a week to pare compare clothing.",
    "Interesting form of murder we come up with: Assassination. We assassinate people who've told us to live together in harmony and try to love one another. Apparently we are not ready to live together.",
    "You ever notice that? Any time you see two groups of people who really hate each other, chances are good they're wearing different kind of hats. Keep an eye on that, it might be important.",

    "I think it would be interesting if old people got anti-Alzheimer's disease where they slowly began to recover other people's lost memories.",
    "I became a guy who wanted to be a comedian someday, or a comic actor. The way I put it was, I'll be like Danny Kaye. He was kind of the model I had in mind.",
    "When it comes to bullshit, you have to stand in awe of the all-time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims: religion... Religion easily has the greatest bullshit story ever told. Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do.",
    "I quit school in ninth grade, even though I was good at the studies. I knew I didn't need school for what I wanted.",

    "Why do croutons come in airtight packages? It's just stale bread to begin with.",
    "An outsider longing to be on the inside is the same as the soloist longing to work in an ensemble. I get great satisfaction in being a part of the proper - for me - community. I'm uncomfortable with various social groupings and clusterings. But when I'm in the right group, doing the right thing, I get as much satisfaction out of that as anyone who does it all the time.",
    "It's a \"keep your fingers crossed\" business, the entertainment business.",
    "Sometimes, after I'd gone at the coke like one of those snow plows moving up First Avenue, I'd think my heart was over on the dresser, pounding, and I was watching it. I asked some of the doctors who drifted through the intensive-care unit what kind of effect total cocaine abuse has on the heart and they said things like, \"Well, there's not enough valid information....\" That kind of answer.",
    "What I hated most was seeing those priests and brothers getting so much pleasure out of inflicting pain. I wondered what was wrong with them.",
    "The rebellious mood of the country during those [60th] years allowed me to plug right back into my old hatreds. I could scream and holler, as I did on the albums, against religion, government, big business - all those assholes and their values. That hatred was very real.",
    "First I was a mimic. Practically from the moment I began talking, I did impersonations of the people in my neighborhood - the storekeepers, the policemen, my teachers.",
    "I suspect there really was more to my accident than bad luck. I think it was God's way of punishing my nose.",
    "I gravitated toward being a funny guy. I liked the radio comedians. I lived in the Golden Age of radio, and the Golden Age of television came along when I was still in my early teens.",
    "Brenda [Carlin] went into therapy and I soon joined her. First we put the drugs behind us, then we began serious work on our relationship. And, in time, we got well together.She just drove through a hotel lobby. Now, that's bottoming out.",
    "So I want to thank the Pentagon, the Soviet Union and the military-industrial complex from the bottom of my heart. Without them, I could never have become the man I am today.",
    "I was kind of sweet kid, according my mother, and my recollections. Thoughtful and good, but kind of alone - although I didn't interpret it that way, as such. Children never interpret these things. They think they understand logically.",
    "The women who line up at a comic's dressing-room door are not what you'd call your class groupies.",
    "I always knew I could hold people's attention and make them laugh every 30 or 40 seconds, and I got approval and attention for that, so the behavior was reinforced. Later, that became an important skill on the street corner.",

    "Next time you see someone sleeping, make believe you're in a science fiction movie. And whisper, 'The creature is regenerating itself.'",
    "There's a thrill when you steal something in plain view of other people. When you drop a newspaper over a sign and walk away with it, or take something off a wall and the sound of the glue ripping makes people turn around. Your heart is racing, it's a rush.",
    "We are all precancerous.",
    "Because Brenda [Carlin] had a drinking problem along with the coke, she had to hit bottom first. Most alcoholics do. And for her, bottom was an automobile accident that almost landed her in jail.",

    "My mother and her plans for my future. She had it all worked out. I would attend a nice college, then get a job in advertising. \"You'll be one of those smart-looking fellows in their Madison Avenue suits.\" And I rebelled against [my mother] and her values and her plans for my future at every opportunity.",
    "I became a radio nut. I loved the afternoon serials, and I got into jazz through the radio. I had a subscription to Down Beat when I was 12. And I'd spend a lot of time in front of the minor, miming records.",
    "My mother didn't get home until about seven most nights and, yes, there was a sense of being very alone after school. She gave me all the proper guidance and influences, but physically, she just couldn't be there.",
    "The older I got, the more apparent it became that my mother was losing control over me. She fought back fiercely with black moods, silent treatments and martyrdom. And, of course, all she did was run my ass out of the house even quicker. The pressure was unbearable.",
    "I'm offering a special prize for the first Buick on the moon.",
    "I grew up in New York wanting to be like those funny men in the movies and on the radio.",
    "Life is not that complicated.",
    "There's a thing about cocaine - when I was doing it secretly, it didn't make me very sociable. I forget how others were, but it made me very inner-directed. So being in a sketch and rehearsing and the \"hail fellow well met\" camaraderie and all that stuff, I couldn't fake that or force that. It was painful.",
    "In some hotels they give you a little sewing kit. You know what I do? I sew the towels together. One time I sewed a button on a lampshade. I like to leave a mark.",

I didn't write \"Paradox Of Our Time.\" I didn't write \"George Carlin On Aging.\" I didn't write a eulogy for my wife after she died. I didn't write the New Orleans thing. I didn't write \"I Am A Bad American.\" None of them. You know what I've decided to do? I'm going to get a little cheap put-it-together-yourself website called NotMe.com.",
    "I am not a difficult man by any stretch, and I'm saying that with a full and honest inventory going on. I'm not. And I'm not angry on stage. There is a heightening. There is an intensification of the feelings on stage in order to let them carry the room. There is a theatricality about it. The whole thing is oratory, so there's persuasion involved. There's the art of rhetoric involved. And so, with hyperbole and with the desire to really punch the thing home, some of it reads a little more angry.",
    "I don't see much of a future for this planet. I think it's a cursed planet. The boundaries we've drawn between nations and the profit motive - those two factors have, in my opinion, brought us to the point where almost nothing can stop the utter destruction of the environment and all our earthly life-support systems.",
    "Most of the note-taking happens while I'm watching television. It's a broad window on the world, and a lot of things are already established in my mind as things I say, things that I'm interested in, things that are fodder for my [stand-up] machine. And when I see something that relates to one of them, I know it instantly and if it's a further exaggeration and a further addition, or an exception - if it plays into furthering my purpose, I jot it down.",

    "I always have these little internal monologues. You'll get used to them.",
    "In my neighborhood - West 121st Street in New York, \"white Harlem\" - there were only two drugs: smack and marijuana. By the time I was 13, some friends and I were using marijuana fairly regularly. The Reefer Madness myth was still very strong then, but I'd been into jazz and those lyrics included so many casual references to pot that it was completely demystified for me.",
    "To my surprise, my marijuana use has been tapering off steadily.",
    "I was a stonehead for 30 years. I'd wake up in the morning and if I couldn't decide whether I wanted a joint or not, I'd smoke a joint to figure it out. And I stayed high all day long.",
    "The Class Clown album was done totally sober. I'd realized what a hell I'd made for myself and I cleaned up completely for three months. You can hear the clarity of my thinking and of my speech on that album.",
    "I remember when I was a kid I used to come home from Sunday School and my mother would get drunk and try to make pancakes",
    "The fact that I didn't finish school left me with a lifelong need to prove that I'm smart, prove it to myself, maybe to the world. I [also] needed to be - not the center of attention - but I needed to be able to attract attention when I wanted it, through my stunts and my fooling around physically with faces or postures or voices I would do. Those things are important elements in the drive behind all of this [my career].",
    "And off we go, out onto the highway looking for a little fun. Perhaps a flatbed truck loaded with human cadavers will explode in front of a Star Trek reunion. One can only dream and hope.",
    "For an entertainer, part of the thing you do is just style. And the coke did help me get into great runs of pure form.",
    "I profess no belief in God, which by definition is true, especially if we take the accepted definition of God. But to be an atheist is to also have a belief, and have a system, and I don't know that I like that either.",

    "In terms of coke, the only money I ever thought about was that dollar bill I had stuck up my nose.",
    "I'd go on runs [on cocaine ], four and five days without sleep. Then I'd crash and sleep about 18 hours a day for seven to ten days. Then it would take a few more weeks to get over a vague sort of depression. Then I'd be off on another run.",
    "There are an awful lot of things in the cut of street drugs that eventually make you sick. I reached a point where the skin around the edges of my fingernails used to hurt all the time. And it would peel away easily. Now, that must have been from some poison in the cut.",
    "I love and treasure individuals as I meet them, I loath and despise the groups they identify or belong to.",
    "The writing is what gives me the joy, especially editing myself for the page, and getting something ready to show to the editors, and then to have a first draft and get it back and work to fix it, I love reworking, I love editing, love love love revision, revision, revision, revision.",

    "When I was in seventh grade, I was caught stealing money from the visiting team's locker room during a basketball game. So I was sent to The Brothers. That's what they called this parochial school up in Goshen, New York. I was supposed to get closer supervision there and more \"masculine influence,\" whatever that means.

    "As far as I'm concerned, humans have not yet come up with a belief that's worth believing.",

But that's all. Cute...and fictional. But if you think you do have rights, let me ask you this, \"where do they come from?\" People say, \"They come from God. They're God given rights.\" Awww fuck, here we go again...here we go again.The God excuse, the last refuge of a man with no answers and no argument, \"It came from God.\" Anything we can't describe must have come from God. Personally folks, I believe that if your rights came from God, he would've given you the right for some food every day, and he would've given you the right to a roof over your head. GOD would've been looking out for ya. You know that.He wouldn't have been worried making sure you have a gun so you can get drunk on Sunday night and kill your girlfriend's parents.But let's say it's true. Let's say that God gave us these rights. Why would he give us a certain number of rights?The Bill of Rights of this country has 10 stipulations. OK...10 rights. And apparently God was doing sloppy work that week, because we've had to ammend the bill of rights an additional 17 times. So God forgot a couple of things, like...SLAVERY. Just fuckin' slipped his mind.But let's say...let's say God gave us the original 10. He gave the british 13. The british Bill of Rights has 13 stipulations. The Germans have 29, the Belgians have 25, the Sweedish have only 6, and some people in the world have no rights at all. What kind of a fuckin' god damn god given deal is that!?...NO RIGHTS AT ALL!? Why would God give different people in different countries a different numbers of different rights? Boredom? Amusement? Bad arithmetic? Do we find out at long last after all this time that God is weak in math skills? Doesn't sound like divine planning to me. Sounds more like human planning . Sounds more like one group trying to control another group. In other words...business as usual in America.Now, if you think you do have rights, I have one last assignment for ya. Next time you're at the computer get on the Internet, go to Wikipedia. When you get to Wikipedia, in the search field for Wikipedia, i want to type in, \"Japanese-Americans 1942\" and you'll find out all about your precious fucking rights. Alright. You know about it.In 1942 there were 110,000 Japanese-American citizens, in good standing, law abiding people, who were thrown into internment camps simply because their parents were born in the wrong country. That's all they did wrong. They had no right to a lawyer, no right to a fair trial, no right to a jury of their peers, no right to due process of any kind. The only right they had was...right this way! Into the internment camps.Just when these American citizens needed their rights the most...their government took them away. and rights aren't rights if someone can take em away. They're priveledges. That's all we've ever had in this country is a bill of TEMPORARY priviledges; and if you read the news, even badly, you know the list get's shorter, and shorter, and shorter.Yeup, sooner or later the people in this country are going to realize the government doesn't give a fuck about them. the government doesn't care about you, or your children, or your rights, or your welfare or your safety. it simply doesn't give a fuck about you. It's interested in it's own power. That's the only thing...keeping it, and expanding wherever possible.Personally when it comes to rights, I think one of two things is true: either we have unlimited rights, or we have no rights at all.",

Has been for thousands of years. Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Christians all taking turns killing each other ‘cause God told them it was a good idea. The sword of God, the blood of the land, vengeance is mine. Millions of dead motherfuckers. Millions of dead motherfuckers all because they gave the wrong answer to the God question. “You believe in God?” “No.” Boom. Dead. “You believe in God?” “Yes.” “You believe in my God? “No.” Boom. Dead. “My God has a bigger dick than your God!” Thousands of years. Thousands of years, and all the best wars, too. The bloodiest, most brutal wars fought, all based on religious hatred. Which is fine with me. Hey, any time a bunch of holy people want to kill each other I’m a happy guy.But don’t be giving me all this shit about the sanctity of life. I mean, even if there were such a thing, I don’t think it’s something you can blame on God. No, you know where the sanctity of life came from? We made it up. You know why? ‘Cause we’re alive. Self-interest. Living people have a strong interest in promoting the idea that somehow life is sacred. You don’t see Abbott and Costello running around, talking about this shit, do you? We’re not hearing a whole lot from Mussolini on the subject. What’s the latest from JFK? Not a goddamn thing. ‘Cause JFK, Mussolini and Abbott and Costello are fucking dead. They’re fucking dead. And dead people give less than a shit about the sanctity of life. Only living people care about it so the whole thing grows out of a completely biased point of view. It’s a self serving, man-made bullshit story.It’s one of these things we tell ourselves so we’ll feel noble. Life is sacred. Makes you feel noble. Well let me ask you this: if everything that ever lived is dead, and everything alive is gonna die, where does the sacred part come in? I’m having trouble with that. ‘Cuz, I mean, even with all this stuff we preach about the sanctity of life, we don’t practice it. We don’t practice it. Look at what we’d kill: Mosquitoes and flies. ‘Cause they’re pests. Lions and tigers. ‘Cause it’s fun! Chickens and pigs. ‘Cause we’re hungry. Pheasants and quails. ‘Cause it’s fun. And we’re hungry. And people. We kill people… ‘Cause they’re pests. And it’s fun!And you might have noticed something else. The sanctity of life doesn’t seem to apply to cancer cells, does it? You rarely see a bumper sticker that says “Save the tumors.”. Or “I brake for advanced melanoma.”. No, viruses, mold, mildew, maggots, fungus, weeds, E. Coli bacteria, the crabs. Nothing sacred about those things. So at best the sanctity of life is kind of a selective thing. We get to choose which forms of life we feel are sacred, and we get to kill the rest. Pretty neat deal, huh? You know how we got it? We made the whole fucking thing up! Made it up!”",

I view my species with a combination of wonder and pity, and I root for its destruction. And please don’t confuse my point of view with cynicism–the real cynics are the ones who tell you everything’s gonna be all right.And P.P.S., by the way, if by some chance you folks do manage to straighten things out and make everything better, I still don’t wish to be included.",

Tenemos casas más grandes y familias más pequeñas,  más conveniencias, pero menos tiempo. Tenemos más grados pero menos sentido,  más conocimiento, pero menos juicio,  más expertos, sin embargo más problemas, más medicina, pero menos bienestar.Bebemos demasiado, fumamos demasiado, gastamos muy imprudentemente, reímos muy poco,  manejamos demasiado rápido, nos ponemos demasiado irritados, nos estamos hasta muy tarde en la noche, nos levantamos demasiado cansados,  leemos muy poco, miramos demasiada TV, y rezamos muy rara vez. Hemos multiplicado nuestras posesiones, pero reducido nuestros valores. Hablamos demasiado, amamos muy rara vez, y odiamos muy a menudo.

Éstos son los días de viajes rápidos, pañales desechables, moralidad desechable,  encuentros amorosos de una sola noche, cuerpos con sobrepeso, y pastillas que hacen de todo, desde animar, a aquietar, a matar.Es un tiempo cuando hay mucho en la vidriera del mostrador y nada en el almacén.

Recuerden decir una palabra amable a alguien quien los mira maravillado, porque esa personita crecerá y dejará de estar a su lado.Recuerden dar un caluroso abrazo a alguien cercano a ustedes, porque es ése el único tesoro que pueden dar con el corazón y no cuesta un centavo. Recuerden decir “te amo a su pareja y a sus seres queridos, pero principalmente, háganlo con intención.Un beso y un abrazo repararán heridas cuando viene de muy adentro de ustedes. Recuerden cogerse de las manos y compartan el momento porque algún día esa persona no estará allí de nuevo.¡Dense tiempo para amar, dense tiempo para hablar!
