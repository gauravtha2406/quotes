    "The I is always in the field of the Other.",
    "...Desire, a function central to all human experience, is the desire for nothing nameable. And at the same time this desire lies at the origin of every variety of animation. If being were only what it is, there wouldn’t even be room to talk about it. Being comes into existence as an exact function of this lack.",
    "What does it matter how many lovers you have if none of them gives you the universe?",
    "I always speak the truth. Not the whole truth, because there's no way, to say it all. Saying it all is literally impossible: words fail. Yet it's through this very impossibility that the truth holds onto the real.",
    "The reason we go to poetry is not for wisdom, but for the dismantling of wisdom",

    "The evil eye is the fascinum, it is that which has the effect of arresting movement and, literally, of killing life. At the moment the subject stops, suspending his gesture, he is mortified. This anti-life, anti-movement function of the terminal point is the fascinum, and it is precisely one of the dimensions in which the power of the gaze is exercised directly.",
    "The only thing of which one can be guilty is of having given ground relative to one's desire.",
    "Meaning is produced not only by the relationship between the signifier and the signified but also, crucially, by the position of the signifiers in relation to other signifiers.",
    "I identify myself in language, but only by losing myself in it like an object. What is realised in my history is not the past definite of what was, since it is no more, or even the present perfect of what has been in what I am, but the future anterior of what I shall have been for what I am in the process of becoming.",
    "The unconscious is structured like a language.",
    "Obsessional does not necessarily mean sexual obsession, not even obsession for this, or for that in particular; to be an obsessional means to find oneself caught in a mechanism, in a trap increasingly demanding and endless.",

    "What could be more convincing, moreover, than the gesture of laying one's cards face up on the table?",
    "Symptoms, those you believe you recognize, seem to you irrational because you take them in an isolated manner, and you want to interpret them directly.",
    "The sentence completes its signification only with its last term.",

    "The Mirror Stage as formative in the function of the I as revealed in psychoanalytic experience.",
    "The sufferings of neurosis and psychosis are for us a schooling in the passions of the soul, just as the beam of the psychoanalytic scales, when we calculate the tilt of its threat to entire communities, provides us with an indication of the deadening of the passions in society.",
    "Aside from that reservation, a fictive tale even has the advantage of manifesting symbolic necessity more purely to the extent that we may believe its conception arbitrary.",
    "If psychoanalysis clarifies some facts of sexuality, it is not by aiming at them in their own reality, not in biological experience.",
    "Yet, analytical truth is not as mysterious, or as secret, so as to not allow us to see that people with a talent for directing consciences see truth rise spontaneously.",
    "My thesis is that the moral law is articulated with relation to the real as such, to the real insofar as it can be the guarantee of the Thing.",
    "As is known, it is in the realm of experience inaugurated by psychoanalysis that we may grasp along what imaginary lines the human organism, in the most intimate recesses of its being, manifests its capture in a symbolic dimension.",
    "We emphasize that such a form of communication is not absent in man, however evanescent a naturally given object may be for him, split as it is in its submission to symbols.",

    "by Baudelaire! things are pretty hot!",
    "I speak without knowing it. I speak with my body and I do so unbeknownst to myself. Thus I always say more than I know. This is where I arrive at the meaning of the word \"subject\" in analytic discourse. What speaks without knowing it makes me \"I,\" subject of the verb. That doesn't suffice to bring me into being. That has nothing to do with what I am forced to put in — enough knowledge for it to hold up, but not one drop more.",

    "That the Sadian fantasy situates itself better in the bearers of Christian ethics than elsewhere is what our structural landmarks allow us to grasp easily. But that Sade, himself, refuses to be my neighbor, is what needs to be recalled, not in order to refuse it to him in return, but in order to recognize the meaning of this refusal. We believe that Sade is not close enough to his own wickedness to recognize his neighbor in it. A trait which he shares with many, and notably with Freud. For such is indeed the sole motive of the recoil of beings, sometimes forewarned, before the Christian commandment. For Sade, we see the test of this, crucial in our eyes, in his refusal of the death penalty, which history, if not logic, would suffice to show is one of the corollaries of Charity.",

    "Many people talk about messages everywhere, inside the organism a hormone is a message, a beam of light to obtain teleguidance to a plane or from a satellite is a message, and so on; but the message in language is absolutely different. The message. Our message, in all cases comes from the Other by which I understand “from the place of the Other.",

    "Çünkü günah kanun olmadan yaşayamaz. Bir zamanlar kanun yoktu ve ben hayattaydım, ama sonra buyruk gelince günah dirildi ve ben öldüm. Ve gördüm ki hayat getirmesi gereken buyruk, ölüm getirdi. Çünkü buyruktan fırsat bulan günah beni kandırdı, ve böylece beni öldürdü. [Romans, 7:7-11]",

    "İnsan kendi arzusuna ayak uydurmada giderek acizleşir. Hatta bu acizliği cinsel tetiklenmeyi kaybettirecek raddeye bile ulaşabilir.

    "[...] la historia del deseo se organiza como un discurso que se desarrolla en lo insensato. Esto es el inconsciente. Los desplazamientos y condensaciones en el discurso del inconsciente son sin duda alguna lo que en el discurso en general constituyen desplazamientos y condensaciones, o sea, metonimias y metáforas. Pero aquí son metáforas que no engendran sentido alguno, y desplazamientos que no transportan ningún ser y en los cuales el sujeto no reconoce algo que se desplace.",
    "It is only on the basis of the clinical facts that any discussion can be fruitful. These facts reveal a relation of the subject to the phallus that is established without regard to the anatomical difference of the sexes, and which, by this very fact, makes any interpretation of this relation especially difficult in the case of women. This problem may be treated under the following four headings: (1) from this 'why', the little girl considers herself, if only momentarily, as castrated, in the sense of deprived of the phallus, by someone, in the first instance by her mother, an important point, and then by her father, but in such a way that one must recognize in it a transference in the analytic sense of the term;",

    "The hand that extends toward the fruit, the rose, or the log that suddenly bursts into flames – its gesture of reaching, drawing close, or stirring up is closely related to the ripening of the fruit, the beauty of the flower, and the blazing of the log. If, in the movement of reaching, drawing, or stirring, the hand goes far enough toward the object that another hand comes out of the fruit, flower, or log and extends toward your hand – and at that moment your hand freezes in the closed plenitude of the fruit, in the open plenitude of the flower, or in the explosion of a log which bursts into flames – then what is produced is love.",

    "Je suis à la place d'où se vocifèe que \"l'univers est un défaut dans la pureté du Non-Être\". Et ceci non pas sans raison, car à se garder, cette place fait languir l'Être lui-même. Elle s'appelle la Jouissance, et c'est elle dont le défaut rendrait vain l'univers. En ai-je donc la charge? -- Oui sans doute. Cette jouissance dont le manque fait l'Autre inconsistant, est-elle donc la mienne? L'expérience prouve qu'elle m'est ordinairement interdite, et ceci non pas seulement, comme le croiraient les imbéciles, par un mauvais arrangement de la société, mais je dirais par la faute de l'Autre s'il existait: l'Autre n'existant pas, il ne me reste qu'à prendre la faute sur Je, c'est-à-dire à croire à ce à quoi l'expérience nous conduit tous, Freud en tête: au péché originel.",
