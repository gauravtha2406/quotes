    "Find a guy who calls you beautiful instead of hot, who calls you back when you hang up on him, who will lie under the stars and listen to your heartbeat, or will stay awake just to watch you sleep...wait for the boy who kisses your forehead, who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats, who holds your hand in front of his friends, who thinks you're just as pretty without makeup on. One who is constantly reminding you of how much he cares and how lucky his is to have you....The one who turns to his friends and says, 'that's her.'",

    "If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't.",
    "People don't want their lives fixed. Nobody wants their problems solved. Their dramas. Their distractions. Their stories resolved. Their messed cleaned up. Because what would they have left? Just the big scary unknown.",
    "You have a class of young strong men and women, and they want to give their lives to something. Advertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they don't need. Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don't really need. We don't have a great war in our generation, or a great depression, but we do, we have a great war of the spirit. We have a great revolution against the culture. The great depression is our lives. We have a spiritual depression.",
    "The unreal is more powerful than the real. Because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it. Because its only intangible ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles. Wood rots. People, well, they die. But things as fragile as a thought, a dream, a legend, they can go on and on. If you can change the way people think. The way they see themselves. The way they see the world. You can change the way people live their lives. That's the only lasting thing you can create.",
    "A good story should change the way you see the world.",
    "Real smarts begin when you quit quoting other people.",
    "Big Brother isn't watching. He's singing and dancing. He's pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big Brother's busy holding your attention every moment you're awake. He's making sure you're always distracted. He's making sure you're fully absorbed. He's making sure your imagination withers. Until it's as useful as your appendix. He's making sure your attention is always filled. And this being fed, it's worse than being watched. With the world always filling you, no one has to worry about what's in your mind. With everyone's imagination atrophied, no one will ever be a threat to the world.",
    "Yes, terrible things happen, but sometimes those terrible things - they save you.",
    "Don't do what you want. Do what you don't want. Do what you're trained not to want. Do the things that scare you the most.",
    "This is your life and its ending one moment at a time.",
    "If you can change the way people think. The way they see themselves. The way they see the world. If you do that, you can change the way people live their lives. That's the only lasting thing you can create.",
    "The one you love and the one who loves you are never, ever the same person.",
    "May I never be complete. May I never be content. May I never be perfect.",
    "I would say any behavior that is not the status quo is interpreted as insanity, when, in fact, it might actually be enlightenment. Insanity is sorta in the eye of the beholder.",
    "You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life. Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you're satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at least you've got your sofa issue handled. Then the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. The drapes. The rug. Then you're trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, now they own you.",

    "All the effort in the world won't matter if you're not inspired.",

    "Actually, watching television and surfing the Internet are really excellent practice for being dead.",
    "We've spent so much time judging what other people created that we've created very, very little of our own.",
    "Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I've ever known.",
    "Have your adventures, make your mistakes, and choose your friends poorly -- all these make for great stories.",
    "There are only patterns, patterns on top of patterns, patterns that affect other patterns. Patterns hidden by patterns. Patterns within patterns. If you watch close, history does nothing but repeat itself. What we call chaos is just patterns we haven't recognized. What we call random is just patterns we can't decipher. what we can't understand we call nonsense. What we can't read we call gibberish. There is no free will. There are no variables.",
    "We can spend our lives letting the world tell us who we are…Or we can decide for ourselves.",
    "When did the future switch from being a promise to a threat?",
    "I don't know the difference between what I want and what I'm trained to want.",
    "Did perpetual happiness in the Garden of Eden maybe get so boring that eating the apple was justified?",

    "Having nothing to lose is the new wealth.",
    "When you're an addict, you can go without feeling anything except drunk or stoned or hungry. Still, when you compare this to other feelings, to sadness, anger, fear, worry, despair, and depression, well, an addiction no longer looks so bad. It looks like a very viable option.",
    "Find joy in everything you choose to do. Every job, relationship, home... it's your responsibility to love it, or change it.",
    "In truth, the degree of anyone's success depends on how often they can say the word yes and hear the word no.",

    "I don't want to die without any scars.",
    "People don't listen, they just wait for their turn to talk.",

    "Maybe we have to break everything to make something better out of ourselves.",

    "The first step - especially for young people with energy and drive and talent, but not money - the first step to controlling your world is to control your culture. To model and demonstrate the kind of world you demand to live in. To write the books. Make the music. Shoot the films. Paint the art.",
    "To some of us, the nights are too long. To some, the days.",

    "When you understand, that what you're telling is just a story. It isn't happening anymore. When you realize the story you're telling is just words, when you can just crumble up and throw your past in the trashcan, then we'll figure out who you're going to be.",
    "Emotionally, in our minds, we get so filled with resentments where we've got a story about absolutely everything.",
    "The problem with educating stupid people was that they didn’t know they were stupid. The same went for curing crazy people.",
    "If you knew that your life was merely a phase or short, short segment of your entire existence, how would you live? Knowing nothing 'real' was at risk, what would you do? You'd live a gigantic, bold, fun, dazzling life. You know you would. That's what the ghosts want us to do - all the exciting things they no longer can.",
    "People have to really suffer before they can risk doing what they love.",
    "Your birth is a mistake you'll spend your whole life trying to correct.",
    "We can spend our lives letting the world tell us who we are. Sane or insane. Saints or sex addicts. Heroes or victims. Letting history tell us how good or bad we are. Letting our past decide our future. Or we can decide for ourselves. And maybe it's our job to invent something better.",
    "By the time you read this, you'll be older than you remember.",
    "Books can create a depth of story, a background of information and ideas, that televison and movies can't. Sure, the television shows may shock, but only on a superficial level. They'd never risk market share to really explore the issues. They report, but don't analyze or suggest any new ways for living our lives.",
    "The difference between how you look and how you see yourself is enough to kill most people. And maybe the reason vampires don’t die is because they can never see themselves in photographs or mirrors.",
    "If you haven't already noticed, all my books are about a lonely person looking for some way to connect with other people.In a way, that is the opposite of the American Dream: to get so rich you can rise above the rabble, all those people on the freeway or, worse, the bus.",
    "The answer is there is no answer.",
    "Parenthood is the opiate of the masses.",
    "Carl Jung called this his shadow work. He said we never see others. Instead we see only aspects of ourselves that fall over them. Shadows. Projections. Our associations.",

    "We live and we die and anything else is just a delusion.",
    "The only thing that separates us from the animals... is we have pornography.",
    "You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.",

    "Which is worse, hell or nothing?",
    "Everyone holds a certain type of power. For young people, it's their youth, their attractiveness, and their energy. But they're terrified that as those qualities fade, what are they going to replace that form of power with?",
    "What people forget is a journey to nowhere starts with a single step, too.",

    "Nothing feels as awful as pouring your heart out to some talk therapist, then realizing this so-called professional is actually vastly stupid and you've just professed your most secret secrets to some goon who's wearing one brown sock and one blue sock.",
    "What I'm always trying to do with every book is to recreate the effect of the stories we heard as children in front of campfires and fireplaces - the ghost stories that engaged us.",
    "Some of us are lucky enough to fall in love once or twice but the luckiest of us are those who find that someone they simply can't live without and have the pleasure of falling in love with them day in and day out for the rest of their lives. Relationships aren't about simply falling in love once and being done with it, they're about loving someone until the end of your days and growing that love endlessly.",
    "Las Vegas looks the way you'd imagine heaven must look at night.",
    "You realize you have no control over how you're perceived.",
    "On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.",
    "We're all going overnight express delivery straight to Hell.",
    "I admire addicts. In a world where everybody is waiting for some blind, random disaster or some sudden disease, the addict has the comfort of knowing what will most likely wait for him down the road. He's taken some control over his ultimate fate, and his addiction keeps the cause of his death from being a total surprise.",
    "If the living are haunted by the dead, then the dead are haunted by their own mistakes.",
    "There's a big difference between \"not caring\" or being \"nihilistic\" about a topic and simply not being enrolled by the drama presented by other people. Just because my characters choose not to react in standard, socially-appropriate ways - that does not mean they don't care. They just reject ordinary dramas.",
    "You become smart when you don't need to quote someone anymore.\" I am still stupid: I quoted Chuck Palahiniuk",
    "It's creepy, but here we are, the Pilgrims, the crackpots of our time, trying to establish our own alternate reality. To build a world out of rocks and chaos. What it's going to be, I don't know. Even after all that rushing around, where we've ended up is the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night. And maybe knowing isn't the point. Where we're standing right now, in the ruins in the dark, what we build could be anything.",
    "It's pathetic how we can't live with the things we can't understand. How we need everything labeled and explained and deconstructed.",
    "The world will always punish the few people with special talents the rest of us don’t recognize as real.",
    "People didn't know who I was or why I was there, so they started inventing stories about me. I was a registered sex offender and I'd just been released from prison and was being forced to do community-service work. I was a murderer, an arsonist - all these horrific things had been projected on me because no one knew what to make of this white guy who showed up and made toast at 5 o'clock every morning.",
    "If death meant just leaving the stage long enough to change costume and come back as a new character, would you slow down? Or speed up?",

    "If You Don’t Claim Your Humanity, You Will Become A Statistic.",
    "Intellectual culture seems to separate high art from low art. Low art is horror or pornography or anything that has a physical component to it and engages the reader on a visceral level and evokes a strong sympathetic reaction. High art is people driving in Volvos and talking a lot. I just don't want to keep those things separate. I think you can use visceral physical experiences to illustrate larger ideas, whether they're emotional or spiritual. I'm trying to not exclude high and low art or separate them.",
    "Angel says that rich people don't like to tolerate much. Money gives you permission to just walk away from everything that isn't pretty and perfect. You can't put up with anything less than lovely. You spend your life running, avoiding, escaping.",
    "When nobody will look at you, you can stare a hole in them. Picking out all the little details you'd never stare long enough to get if they'd even just return your gaze, this, this is your revenge.",

    "First your parents, they give you your life, but then they try to give you their life.",
    "I take pens and I write on the inside of my arm. When I'm with people and somebody says a really fascinating anecdote, or fact, or phrase, I'll write it on the inside of my arm. At the end of the day, I'll take the very best things that are on my arm and I'll copy them into a notebook that I always carry and only when the weather is absolutely terrible will I really key the very best of that notebook into the computer. At that point, it's all sort of censored twice - only the best things go from the arm to the book and only the best things go from the book to the computer.",
    "Because after you've crossed some lines, you just keep crossing them. And there's no escaping from constant escape. Distracting ourselves. Avoiding confrontation. Getting past the moment. Jacking off. Television. Denial.",
    "It's only in drugs or death we'll see anything new, and death is just too controlling.",
    "When we die, these are the stories still on our lips. The stories we’ll only tell strangers, someplace private in the padded cell of midnight. These important stories, we rehearse them for years in our head but never tell. These stories are ghosts, bringing people back from the dead. Just for a moment. For a visit. Every story is a ghost.",
    "Everything is funnier in retrospect, funnier and prettier and cooler. You can laugh at anything from far enough away.",
    "I always really curious to see how people interpret things. I know my version, and I'm kind of bored with my version so I want to see their version.",
    "There are the most fantastic, beautiful things and people out there. It’s up to you to find them.",
    "Without just one nest\nA bird can call the world home\nLife is your career",
    "I'm always identifying some fallacy in my own life. I'm sort of making fun of myself by exploring and unpacking just why I'm sort of automatically thrown to be a certain way.",
    "You have endless ways you can commit suicide without dying dying.",
    "This is how it is with insomnia. Everything is so far away, a copy of a copy of a copy. The insomnia distance of everything, you can't touch anything and nothing can touch you.",
    "Worker bees can leave. Even drones can fly away. The Queen is their slave.",
    "The government says Rant's alive because they need a villain. The kids say he's alive because they need a hero.",
    "You tell yourself that noise is what defines silence. Without noise, silence would not be golden. Noise is the exception. Think of deep outer space, the incredible cold and quiet where your wife and kid wait. Silence, not heaven, would be reward enough.",
    "Maybe the only thing each of us can see is our own shadow. Carl Jung called this his shadow work. He said we never see others. Instead we see only aspects of ourselves that fall over them. Shadows. Projections. Our associations. The same way old painters would sit in a tiny dark room and trace the image of what stood outside a tiny window, in the bright sunlight. The camera obscura. Not the exact image, but everything reversed or upside down.",
    "I just don't want to die without a few scars.",
    "Hey, even the Mona Lisa is falling apart.",
    "The truth is, immigrants tend to be more American than people born here.",

    "There will always be an underground.",
    "There's a moment in every book when the book turns and it surprises me.",
    "I'm not sure what we're running from. Nobody. Or the future. Fate. Growing up. Getting old. Picking up the pieces. As if running we won't have to get on with our lives.",
    "I don't want to die without a few scars.",
    "For years now, I've wanted to fall asleep. The sort of slipping off, the giving up, the falling part of sleep. Now sleeping is the last thing I want to do.",
    "Make me into anything, but just love me.",
    "We're all trapped. It's always 1734. All of us, we're stuck in the same time capsule, the same as those television shows where the same people are marooned on the same desert island for thirty seasons and never age or escape. They just wear more makeup. In a creepy way, those shows are maybe too authentic.",
    "She's not wearing makeup so her face just looks like skin.",

    "I've met God across his long walnut desk with his diplomas hanging on the wall behind him, and God asks me, 'Why?' Why did I cause so much pain? Didn't I realize that each of us is a sacred, unique snowflake of special unique specialness? Can't I see how we're all manifestations of love? I look at God behind his desk, taking notes on a pad, but God's got this all wrong. We are not special. We are not crap or trash, either. We just are. We just are, and what happens just happens. And God says, 'No, that's not right.' Yeah. Well. Whatever. You can't teach God anything.",

    "The things you used to own, now they own you.",
    "Tyler lies back and asks, \"If Marilyn Monroe were alive right now, what would she be doing?\" I say, goodnight. The headliner hangs down in shreds from the ceiling and Tyler says, \"Clawing at the lid of her coffin.",
    "The joke is, we all have the same punchline.",
    "You gain power by pretending to be weak.",
    "You have a choice. Live or die. Every breath is a choice. Every minute is a choice. Every time you don't throw yourself down the stairs, that's a choice. Every time you don't crash your car, you re-enlist.",
    "Art never comes from happiness.",
    "Picture anybody growing up so stupid he didn't know that hope is just another phase you'll grow out of.",
    "You realize that people take drugs because it's the only real personal adventure left to them in their time-constrained, law-and-order, property-lined world. It's only in drugs or death we'll see anything new, and death is just too controlling.",

    "Anything you can aquire is only another thing you'll lose.",
    "Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don't really need.",
    "Nevertheless, if you ask me, most people have children just as their own enthusiasm about life begins to wane. A child allows us to revisit the excitement we once felt about, well... everything. A generation later, our grandkids bump up our enthusiasm yet again. Reproducing is a kind of booster shot to keep us loving life.",

    "Since change is constant, you wonder if people crave death because it's the only way they can get anything really finished.",
    "Ideas come at any moment -- except when you demand them. Most ideas come while I'm physically active, at the gym, with friends, gardening, so I always carry pen and paper. My first draft is always written in longhand. But once the first dozen chapters, more like short stories, are written, then momentum builds until I can't leave the project until it's done.",

And what happens to us—the drama and pain and joy and war and sickness and victory and abuse—why, that’s just the water and sand to erode us. Grind us down. To polish us up, nice and bright.",

    "Beginning with Santa Claus as a cognitive exercise, a child is encouraged to share the same idea of reality as his peers. Even if that reality is patently invented and ludicrous, belief is encouraged with gifts that support and promote the common cultural lies.

So I'm always looking for, number one, a non-fiction context - because you can tell a more outrageous story if you use a non-fiction form.",

That is what is going to make people like them.",
    "I think we're in an age starved for genuine experiences, instead of cathartic phony experiences through the media, structured, engineered experiences.

Second grade is really where they tell you those horrific jokes, racist jokes and misogynistic jokes that you have no idea what they mean, and you just memorize them because they have a very strong effect, they make people laugh in this kind of nervous, horrible way, and it's only later that you realize that you've got a head full of crap.",

    "There is a social contract in \"Fight Club\" and in \"Choke\" where the protagonist has deceived a whole bunch of people. In \"Choke\" it's all of these people who think that they've saved his life, and really care about him because they've embraced him and they've been his saviors. In \"Fight Club\" it's all of these people who are dying of various diseases, and they thought that Edward Norton was also dying so they allowed him really strong pent-up emotions.",

To pace every story so that there's a setup and a payoff at the page turn was a huge challenge; it's a part of the medium and you really have to learn what can be done in the medium.",
    "It's interesting because when David Fincher was making \"Fight Club,\" he said, \"It's a romance.\" And it really is. Almost everything I ever write is just a romance. And that needed to be sort of pointed up at the end of \"Fight Club.\" The film has a very different ending than the book does.",

    "By first believing in Santa Claus, then the Easter Bunny, then the Tooth Fairy, Rant Casey was recognizing that those myths are more than pretty stories and traditions to delight children. Or to modify behavior. Each of those three traditions asks a child to believe in the impossible in exchange for a reward. These are stepped-up tests to build a child's faith and imagination. The first test is to believe in a magical person, with toys as the reward. The second test is to trust in a magical animal, with candy as the reward. The last test is the most difficult, with the most abstract reward: To believe, trust in a flying fairy that will leave money. From a man to an animal to a fairy. From toys to candy to money. Thus, interestingly enough, transferring the magic of faith and trust from sparkling fairy-dom to clumsy, tarnished coins. From gossamer wings to nickels... dimes... and quarters. In this way, a child is stepped up to greater feats of imagination and faith as he or she matures. Beginning with Santa in infancy, and ending with the Tooth Fairy as the child acquires adult teeth. Or, plainly put, beginning with all the possibility of childhood, and ending with an absolute trust in the national currency.",

    "Each holiday tradition acts as an exercise in cognitive development, a greater challenge for the child. Despite the fact most parents don't recognize this function, they still practice the exercise. Rant also saw how resolving the illusions is crucial to how the child uses any new skills. A child who is never coached with Santa Claus may never develop an ability to imagine. To him, nothing exists except the literal and tangible. A child who is disillusioned abruptly, by his peers or siblings, being ridiculed for his faith and imagination, may choose never to believe in anything- tangible or intangible- again. To never trust or wonder.But a child who relinquishes the illusions of Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy, that child may come away with the most important skill set. That child may recognize the strength of his own imagination and faith. He will embrace the ability to create his own reality. That child becomes his own authority. He determines the nature of his world. His own vision. And by doing so, by the power of his example, he determines the reality of the other two types: those who can't imagine, and those who can't trust.",

The Jews attacked Belial, the god of the Babylonians. The Christians banished Pan and Loki anda Mars, the respective deities of the ancient Greeks and Celts and Romans. The Anglican British banned belief in the Australian aboriginal spirits known as the Mimi. Satan is depicted with cloven hooves because Pan had them, and he carries a pitchfork based on the trident carried by Neptune. As each deity was deposed, it was relegated to Hell.

    "Centuries ago, sailors on long voyages used to leave a pair of pigs on every deserted island. Or they'd leave a pair of goats. Either way, on any future visit, the island would be a source of meat. These islands, they were pristine. These were home to breeds of birds with no natural predators. Breeds of birds that lived nowhere else on earth. The plants there, without enemies they evolved without thorns or poisons. Without predators and enemies, these islands, they were paradise. The sailors, the next time they visited these islands, the only things still there would be herds of goats or pigs. Oyster is telling this story. The sailors called this \"seeding meat.\" Oyster says, \"Does this remind you of anything?

    "Old-time ranchers planted cheatgrass because it would green up fast in the spring and provide early forage for grazing cattle, Oyster says, nodding his head at the world outside. This first patch of cheatgrass was in southern British Columbia, Canada, in 1889. But fire spreads it. Every year, it dries to gunpowder, and now land that used to burn every ten years, it burns every year. And the cheatgrass recovers fast. Cheatgrass loves fire. But the native plants, the sagebrush and desert phlox, they don’t. And every year it burns, there’s more cheatgrass and less anything else. And the deer and antelope that depended on those other plants are gone now. So are the rabbits. So are the hawks and owls that ate the rabbits. The mice starve, so the snakes that ate the mice starve. Today, cheatgrass dominates the inland deserts from Canada to Nevada, covering an area over twice the size of the state of Nebraska and spreading by thousands of acres per year. The big irony is, even cattle hate cheatgrass, Oyster says. So the cows, they eat the rare native bunch grasses. What’s left of them...“When you think about it from a native plant perspective,” Oyster says, “Johnny Appleseed was a fucking biological terrorist.” Johnny Appleseed, he says, might as well be handing out smallpox.”",

    "How I met Tyler was I went to a nude beach. This was the very end of summer, and I was asleep. Tyler was naked and sweating, gritty with sand, his hair wet and stringy, hanging in his face.Tyler had been around before we met.Tyler was pulling driftwood logs out of the surf and dragging them up the beach. In the wet sand, he’d already planted a half circle of logs so they stood a few inches apart and as tall as his eyes. There were four logs, and when I woke up, I watched Tyler pull a fifth log up the beach. Tyler dug a hole under one end of the log, then lifted the other end until the log slid into the hole and stood there at a slight angle.You wake up at the beach.We were the only people on the beach.With a stick, Tyler drew a straight line in the sand several feet away. Tyler went back to straighten the log by stamping sand around its base.I was the only person watching this.Tyler called over, “Do you know what time it is?I always wear a watch,“Do you know what time it is?”I asked, where?“Right here,” Tyler said. “Right now.” It was 4:06 P.M.After a while, Tyler sat cross-legged in the shadow of the standing logs. Tyler sat for a few minutes, got up and took a swim, pulled on a T-shirt and a pair of sweatpants, and started to leave. I had to ask.I had to know what Tyler was doing while I was asleep.If I could wake up in a different place, at a different time, could I wake up as a different person?I asked if Tyler was an artist.Tyler shrugged and showed me how the five standing logs were wider at the base. Tyler showed me the line he’d drawn in the sand, and how he’d used the line to gauge the shadow cast by each log. Sometimes, you wake up and have to ask where you are. What Tyler had created was the shadow of a giant hand. Only now the fingers were Nosferatu-long and the thumb was too short, but he said how at exactly four-thirty the hand was perfect. The giant shadow hand was perfect for one minute, and for one perfect minute Tyler had sat in the palm of a perfection he’d created himself.You wake up, and you’re nowhere.One minute was enough Tyler said, a person had to work hard for it, but a minute of perfection was worth the effort. A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection.You wake up, and that’s enough”",

Kendi kapısını açtı ve çocuğa sürücü tarafına geçip arabadan inmesini söyledi. Yanlarından hızla geçen araçları kontrol etti. Ve, \"Bu bizim arabamız değil\" dedi. ...\"Dünyayı parçalara ayırdık\" diyor, \"ama parçalarla ne yapacağımızı bilemiyoruz...\" ...\"Vaktimizin çoğunu başkalarının yarattığı şeyleri yargılayarak geçirdiğimizden, kendimiz hiçbir şey yaratamadık.\" ......hissettiğimden daha zavallı bir şey görmek iyi geliyor. ...Her bağımlılık aynı sorunu çözmek için bulunmuş bir yöntemdir, dedi.

Elmayı ısırmış olmaktan. ...İnsanlar dünyanın güvenli ve düzenli bir yer olması için yıllarca çalışırlardı. Ama hiç kimse bunun ne kadar sıkıcı olabileceğinin farkında değildi. Bütün dünyanın parsellendiğini, hız limitleri konduğunu, bölümlere ayrıldığını, vergilendirildiğini ve düzenlendiğini, bütün insanların sınavlardan geçirildiğini, fişlendiğini, nerede oturduğunun ne yaptığının kaydının yapıldığını düşünün.

Bunlar Anneciğin ona anlattığı şeylerdi.\"Keşfedilmemiş tek alan, elle tutulamayanların dünyasıdır. Bunun dışındaki her şey çok sıkı örülmüştür\" derdi. Çok fazla kanunun içinde hapsolmuş durumdayız. Elle tutulamayanlar derken interneti, filmleri, müziği, hikayeleri, sanatı, dedikoduları, bilgisayar programlarını, yani gerçek olmayan her şeyi kastediyordu. Sanal gerçeklikten bahsediyordu. Yalandan inanılan şeylerden. Kültürden. Gerçekdışı şeyler, gerçeklikten daha güçlüdür. Çünkü sadece elle tutulamayan fikirler, mefhumlar, inanışlar ve fanteziler kalır. Taşlar ufalanır. Ağaçlar çürür. İnsanlar da maalesef ölürler. Fakat bir düşünce, bir rüya, bir efsane gibi aslında son derece kırılgan şeyler yaşarlar da yaşarlar. ...\"...Beni mahkum etmeniz çok gereksizdi.

    "I say, it sounds like some dangerous psychotic killer wrote this, and this buttoned-down schizophrenic could probably go over the edge at any moment in the working day and stalk from office to office with an Armalite AR-180 carbine gas-operated semiautomatic. My boss just looks at me. The guy, I say, is probably at home every night with a little rattail file, filing a cross into the tip of every one of his rounds. This way, when he shows up to work one morning and pumps a round into his nagging, ineffectual, petty, whining, butt-sucking, candy-ass boss, that one round will split along the filed grooves and spread open the way a dumdum bullet flowers inside you to blow a bushel load of your stinking guts out through your spine. Picture your gut chakra opening in a slow-motion explosion of sausage-casing small intestine. My boss takes the paper out from under my nose. Go ahead, I say, read some more. No really, I say, it sounds fascinating. The work of a totally diseased mind. And I smile. The little butthole-looking edges of the hole in my cheek are the same blue-black as a dog’s gums. The skin stretched tight across the swelling around my eyes feels varnished. My boss just looks at me. Let me help you, I say. I say, the fourth rule of fight club is one fight at a time. My boss looks at the rules and then looks at me. I say, the fifth rule is no shoes, no shirts in the fight. My boss looks at the rules and looks at me. Maybe, I say, this totally diseased fuck would use an Eagle Apache carbine because an Apache takes a thirty-shot mag and only weighs nine pounds. The Armalite only takes a five-round magazine. With thirty shots, our totally fucked hero could go the length of mahogany row and take out every vice-president with a cartridge left over for each director. Tyler’s words coming out of my mouth. I used to be such a nice person. I just look at my boss. My boss has blue, blue, pale cornflower blue eyes. The J and R 68 semiautomatic carbine also takes a thirty-shot mag, and it only weighs seven pounds. My boss just looks at me. It’s scary, I say. This is probably somebody he’s known for years. Probably this guy knows all about him, where he lives, and where his wife works and his kids go to school. This is exhausting, and all of a sudden very, very boring. And why does Tyler need ten copies of the fight club rules? What I don’t have to say is I know about the leather interiors that cause birth defects. I know about the counterfeit brake linings that looked good enough to pass the purchasing agent, but fail after two thousand miles. I know about the air-conditioning rheostat that gets so hot it sets fire to the maps in your glove compartment. I know how many people burn alive because of fuel-injector flashback. I’ve seen people’s legs cut off at the knee when turbochargers start exploding and send their vanes through the firewall and into the passenger compartment. I’ve been out in the field and seen the burned-up cars and seen the reports where CAUSE OF FAILURE is recorded as \"unknown. No, I say, the paper’s not mine. I take the paper between two fingers and jerk it out of his hand. The edge must slice his thumb because his hand flies to his mouth, and he’s sucking hard, eyes wide open. I crumble the paper into a ball and toss it into the trash can next to my desk. Maybe, I say, you shouldn’t be bringing me every little piece of trash you pick up.”",

From shopping the cathedral flea market in Barcelona with David Sedaris to having drinks at Cognac with Nora Ephron just months before she died. To the years of sporadic correspondence I had with Thom Jones and Ira Levin. I’ve stalked my share of mentors, asking for advice.Therefore, if you came back another day and asked me to teach you, I’d tell you that becoming an author involves more than talent and skill. I’ve known fantastic writers who never finished a project. And writers who launched incredible ideas, then never fully executed them. And I’ve seen writers who sold a single book and became so disillusioned by the process that they never wrote another. I’d paraphrase the writer Joy Williams, who says that writers must be smart enough to hatch a brilliant idea—but dull enough to research it, keyboard it, edit and re-edit it, market the manuscript, revise it, revise it, re-revise it, review the copy edit, proofread the typeset galleys, slog through the interviews and write the essays to promote it, and finally to show up in a dozen cities and autograph copies for thousands or tens of thousands of people…And then I’d tell you, “Now get off my porch.But if you came back to me a third time, I’d say, “Kid…” I’d say, “Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”",

To get blood off of piano keys, polish them with talcum powder or powdered milk. This isn’t the most marketable job skill, but to get bloodstains out of wallpaper, put on a paste of cornstarch and cold water. This will work just as well to get blood out of a mattress or a davenport. The trick is to forget how fast these things can happen. Suicides. Accidents. Crimes of passion. Just concentrate on the stain until your memory is completely erased. Practice really does make perfect. If you could call it that. Ignore how it feels when the only real talent you have is for hiding the truth. You have a God-given knack for committing a terrible sin. It’s your calling. You have a natural gift for denial.

Algunas escriben como en las tablillas de maldiciones de la antigua Grecia, con una línea de izquierda a derecha, la siguiente de derecha a izquierda y la siguiente de izquierda a derecha. A esto lo llaman forma de boustrophedon porque imita el recorrido de un lado para otro de un buey uncido. Para imitar a una serpiente, dice Mona, algunas escriben cada línea en una dirección distinta.La única norma es que el conjuro tiene que ser enrevesado.

The bit they trimmed away always served up too bitter or too tough. Whatever the case, her mother had reasoned, this was how she’d been taught by her mother, Lucinda’s grandmother, so this was how she meant to teach her own daughter. “And still”—Foster shrugged and offered up both hands helplessly—“Lucinda insisted they call her grandmother and keep asking.” So they’d called Lucinda’s grandmother. A woman dead of cancer for three years now. And they’d asked why it was so important to trim the smaller end off the pot roast. Here he wound up to deliver the story’s payoff. “It wasn’t because the meat cooked unevenly or dried out,” he said. “It was because the only roasting pan they’d had—so long ago—had only been so-big.” A lesson in perpetuating a mistake across generations. A dozen valid reasons, all wrong.”",
