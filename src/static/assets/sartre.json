Every silence, too.","What is life but an unpleasant interruption to a peaceful nonexistence.","If you are lonely when you're alone, you are in bad company.","Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you.","We are our choices.","Only the guy who isn't rowing has time to rock the boat.","I can always choose, but I ought to know that if I do not choose, I\nam still choosing.","the worst part about being lied to is knowing you werent worth the truth","There may be more beautiful times, but this one is ours.","Man is nothing else but what he purposes, he exists only in so far as he realizes himself, he is therefore nothing else but the sum of his actions, nothing else but what his life is.","Before you come alive, life is nothing; it 's up to you to give it a meaning, and value is nothing else but the meaning that you choose.","He who asks a question is a fool for a minute; he who does not remains a fool forever.\nWhen you realize that by changing your perspective, big things can be seen as little things, it becomes much harder to worry about anything. Commitment is an act, not a word.","To know what life is worth you have to risk it once in a while.","Life begins on the other side of despair.","Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.","There is only one day left, always starting over: it is given to us at dawn and taken away from us at dusk.","Sometimes the truth is too simple for intellectuals.","your judgement judges you and defines you","Man is what he wills himself to be.","We only become what we are by the radical and deep-seated refusal of that which others have made of us.","Life has no meaning the moment you lose the illusion of being eternal.","We make our own hell out of the people around us.","Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself. [It is a matter of choice, not chance.] Such is the first principle of existentialism.","Everything has been figured out, except how to live.","To choose not to choose is still to act.","We do not judge the people we love.","Commitment is an act, not a word.","In love, one and one are one.","I am. I am, I exist, I think, therefore I am; I am because I think, why do I think? I don't want to think any more, I am because I think that I don't want to be, I think that I . . . because . . . ugh!","Words are loaded pistols.","Because we can imagine, we are free.","A kiss without a moustache, they said then, is like an egg without salt; I will add to it: and it is like Good without Evil.","We are possessed by the things we possess. When I like an object, I always give it to someone. It isn't generosity-it's only because I want others to be enslaved by objects, not me.","In life man commits himself and draws his own portrait, outside of which there is nothing. No doubt this thought may seem harsh to someone who has not made a success of his life. But on the other hand, it helps people to understand that reality alone counts, and that dreams, expectations and hopes only serve to define a man as a broken dream, aborted hopes, and futile expectations.","Everything comes to us from others. To Be is to belong to someone.","I'm going to smile, and my smile will sink down into your pupils, and heaven knows what it will become.","I felt myself in a solitude so frightful that I contemplated suicide. What held me back was the idea that no one, absolutely no one, would be moved by my death, that I would be even more alone in death than in life.","Ideas come in pairs and they contradict one another; their opposition is the principal engine of reflection.","I respect orders but I respect myself too and I do not obey foolish rules made especially to humiliate me.","Man is fully responsible for his nature and his choices.","Why do you keep maintaining your ideas are right if you can't prove them?","Nothingness haunts Being.","Once freedom lights its beacon in man's heart, the gods are powerless against him.","The best work is not what is most difficult for you; it is what you do best.","Death is a continuation of my life without me.","Once we know and are aware, we are responsible for our action and our inaction. We can do something about it or ignore it. Either way, we are still responsible.","Man can will nothing unless he has first understood that he must count on no one but himself; that he is alone, abandoned on earth in the midst of his infinite responsibilities, without help, with no other aim than the one he sets himself, with no other destiny than the one he forges for himself on this earth.","Life gave me everything I asked\nIf all I asked was not a great deal, that's my problem!","It's quite an undertaking to start loving somebody. You have to have energy, generosity, blindness. There is even a moment right at the start where you have to jump across an abyss: if you think about it you don't do it.","Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness, and dies by chance.","I had found my religion: nothing seemed more important to me than a book. I saw the library as a temple.","Once you hear the details of victory, it is hard to distinguish it from a defeat.","Three o'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do.","He was free, free in every way, free to behave like a fool or a machine, free to accept, free to refuse, free to equivocate; to marry, to give up the game, to drag this death weight about with him for years to come. He could do what he liked, no one had the right to advise him, there would be for him no Good or Evil unless he thought them into being.","In wanting freedom we discover that it depends entirely on the freedom of others, and that the freedom of others depends on ours. . . I am obliged to want others to have freedom at the same time that I want my own freedom.  I can take freedom as my goal only if I take that of others as a goal as well.","To believe is to know you believe, and to know you believe is not to believe.","There are two ways of destroying a people. Either condemn them en bloc or force them to repudiate the leaders they adopted. The second is the worse.","The individual's duty is to do what he wants to do, to think whatever he likes, to be accountable to no one but himself, to challenge every idea and every person.","Words are more treacherous and powerful than we think.","If you seek authenticity for authenticity's sake you are no longer authentic.","Man can will nothing unless he has first understood that he must count on no one but himself.","I had spent my time counterfeiting eternity.","Fascism is not defined by the number of its victims, but by the way it kills them.","I will not be modest. Humble, as much as you like, but not modest. Modesty is the virtue of the lukewarm.","Violence is good for those who have nothing to lose.","Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.","What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world-and defines himself afterward.","Hell is other people at breakfast.","God is dead. Let us not understand by this that he does not exist or even that he no longer exists. He is dead. He spoke to us and is silent. We no longer have anything but his cadaver. Perhaps he\n slipped out of the world, somewhere else like the soul of a dead man. Perhaps he was only a dream...God is dead.","Philosophy which does not help to illuminate the process of the liberation of the oppressed should be rejected.","There are two types of poor people, those who are poor together and those who are poor alone. The first are the true poor, the others are rich people out of luck.","Evil is the product of the ability of humans to make abstract that which is concrete.","When she is alone in the rooms I hear her humming to keep herself from thinking.","I am alone in the midst of these happy, reasonable voices. All these creatures spend their time explaining, realizing happily that they agree with each other. In Heaven's name, why is it so important to think the same things all together.","I think of death only with tranquility, as an end. I refuse to let death hamper life. Death must enter life only to define it.","Imagination is not an empirical or superadded power of consciousness, it is the whole of consciousness as it realizes its freedom.","I'd come to realize that all our troubles spring from our failure to use plain, clear-cut language.","I want to leave, to go somewhere where I should be really in my place, where I would fit in . . . but my place is nowhere; I am unwanted.","I exist, that is all, and I find it nauseating.","Genius is what a man invents when he is looking for a way out.","I never could bear the idea of anyone's expecting something from me. It always made me want to do just the opposite.","What the painter adds to the canvas are the days of his life. The adventure of living, hurtling toward death.","All I can do is make the best of what I am, become accustomed to it, evaluate the possibilities, and take advantage of them the best I can.","Man is not the sum of what he has already, but rather the sum of what he does not yet have, of what he could have.","I confused things with their names: that is belief.","We must act out passion before we can feel it.","Consciousness is a being the nature of which is to be conscious of the nothingness of its being.","It is only in our decisions that we are important.","As far as men go, it is not what they are that interests me, but what they can become.","One cannot become a saint when one works sixteen hours a day.","If you want to deserve Hell, you need only stay in bed. The world is iniquity; if you accept it, you are an accomplice, if you change it you are an executioner.","I have no religion, but if I were to choose one, it would be that of Shariati's.","The aim of language...is to communicate...to impart to others the results one has obtained...As I talk, I reveal the situation...I reveal it to myself and to others in order to change it.","Like all dreamers, I mistook disenchantment for truth.","My thought is me: that's why I can't stop. I exist because I think… and I can't stop myself from thinking. At this very moment - it's frightful - if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing. I am the one who pulls myself from the nothingness to which I aspire.","I do not believe in God; his existence has been disproved by Science. But in the concentration camp, I learned to believe in men.","It is meaningless that we are born, it is meaningless that we die.","Il n'y a de réalité que dans l'action. (There is no reality except in action.)","He loves me, he doesn't love my bowels, if they showed him my appendix in a glass he wouldn't recognize it, he's always feeling me, but if they put the glass in his hands he wouldn't touch it, he wouldn't think, \"that's hers,\" you ought to love all of somebody, the esophagus, the liver, the intestines. Maybe we don't love them because we aren't used to them, but if we saw them the way we saw our hands and arms maybe we'd love them; the starfish must love each other better than we do.","What is meant here by saying that existence precedes essence? It means first of all, man exists, turns up, appears on the scene, and, only afterwards, defines himself. If man, as the existentialist conceives him, is indefinable, it is because at first he is nothing. Only afterward will he be something, and he himself will have made what he will be.","I am going to outlive myself. Eat, sleep, sleep, eat. Exist slowly, softly, like these trees, like a puddle of water, like the red bench in the streetcar.","He walked on in silence, the solitary sound of his footsteps echoing in his head, as in a deserted street, at dawn. His solitude was so complete, beneath a lovely sky as mellow and serene as a good conscience, amid that busy throng, that he was amazed at his own existence; he must be somebody else's nightmare, and whoever it was would certainly awaken soon.","In football everything is complicated by the presence of the opposite team.","When we love animals and children too much, we love them at the expense of men.","Photographs are not ideas. They give us ideas.","It disturbs me no more to find men base, unjust, or selfish than to see apes mischievous, wolves savage, or the vulture ravenous.","Introspection is always retrospection","It is disgusting -- Why must we have bodies?","God is absence. God is the solitude of man.","The absurd man will not commit suicide; he wants to live, without relinquishing any of his certainty, without a future, without hope, without illusions … and without resignation either. He stares at death with passionate attention and this fascination liberates him. He experiences the “divine irresponsibility” of the condemned man.","I exist. It is soft, so soft, so slow. And light: it seems as though it suspends in the air. It moves.","One of the chief motives of artistic creation is certainly the need of feeling that we are essential in relationship to the world.","We do not know what we want and yet we are responsible for what we are - that is the fact.","Politics is a science. You can demonstrate that you are right and that others are wrong.","The poor don't know that their function in life is to exercise our generosity.","You must be afraid, my son. That is how one becomes an honest citizen.","In a word, man must create his own essence: it is in throwing himself into the world, suffering there, struggling there, that he gradually defines himself.","If you die, I will lie down beside you and I will stay there until the end, without eating or drinking, you will rot in my arms and I will love you as carcass: for you love nothing if you do not love everything.","When the rich [and politically powerful] make war, it's the poor [and politically weak] who die.","She believed in nothing; only her skepticism kept her from being an atheist.","It’s the well-behaved children that make the most formidable revolutionaries. They don’t say a word, they don’t hide under the table, they eat only one piece of chocolate at a time. But later on, they make society pay dearly.","We are now in a position to understand the anti-Semite. He is a man who is afraid. Not of the Jews, to be sure, but of himself, of his own consciousness, of his liberty, of his instincts, of his responsibilities, of solitariness, of change, of society, and of the world of everything except the Jews.","I am no longer sure of anything. If I satiate my desires, I sin but I deliver myself from them; if I refuse to satisfy them, they infect the whole soul.","That’s what existence means: draining one’s own self dry without the sense of thirst.","I have no need for good souls: an accomplice is what I wanted.","Naturally, in the course of my life I have made lots of mistakes, large and small, for one reason or another, but at the heart of it all, every time I made a mistake it was because I was not radical enough.","Several hours or several years make no difference once you have lost eternity.","Every human endeavor, however singular it seems, involves the whole human race.","Nothing happens while you live. The scenery changes, people come in and go out, that's all. There are no beginnings. Days are tacked on to days without rhyme or reason, an interminable, monotonous addition.","Something begins in order to end: an adventure doesn't let itself be extended it achieves significance only through its death.","Life is nothing until it is lived; but it is yours to make sense of, and the of it is nothing other than the sense you choose.","If I became a philosopher, if I have so keenly sought this fame for which I'm still waiting, it's all been to seduce women basically.","Two people can form a community by excluding a third.","A lost battle is a battle one thinks one has lost.","I do not think therefore I am a moustache","People who live in society have learnt how to see themselves, in mirrors, as they appear to their friends. I have no friends: is that why my flesh is so naked?","What is boredom? It is when there is simultaneously too much and not enough.","Every age has its own poetry; in every age the circumstances of history choose a nation, a race, a class to take up the torch by creating situations that can be expressed or transcended only through poetry.","I am beginning to believe that nothing can ever be proved. These are honest hypotheses which take the facts into account: but I sense so definitely that they come from me, and that they are simply a way of unifying my own knowledge. Not a glimmer comes from Rollebon's side. Slow, lazy, sulky, the facts adapt themselves to the rigour of the order I wish to give them; but it remains outside of them. I have the feeling of doing a work of pure imagination.","There are two kinds of existentialist; first, those who are Christian...and on the other hand the atheistic existentialists, among whom...I class myself. What they have in common is that they think that existence precedes essence, or, if you prefer, that subjectivity must be the turning point.","[M]an is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, in other respect is free; because, once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does. The Existentialist does not believe in the power of passion. He will never agree that a sweeping passion is a ravaging torrent which fatally leads a man to certain acts and is therefore an excuse. He thinks that man is responsible for his passion.","When rich people fight wars with one another, poor people are the ones to die.","The more one is absorbed in fighting evil, the less one is tempted to place the good in question.","When one does nothing, one believes oneself responsible for everything.","Acting is a question of absorbing other people's personalities and adding some of your own experience.","I suppose it is out of laziness that the world is the same day after day. Today it seemed to want to change. And then anything, anything could happen.","I hate victims who respect their executioners.","I tell you in truth: all men are Prophets or else God does not exist.","Man is the being whose project it is to be God.","How can I, who was not able to retain my own past, hope to save that of another?","To read a poem in January is as lovely as to go for a walk in June","Our responsibility is much greater than we might have supposed, because it involves all mankind.","We cannot withdraw our cards from the game. Were we as silent and mute as stones, our very passivity would be an act.","Smooth and smiling faces everywhere, but ruin in their eyes.","I wanted pure love: foolishness; to love one another is to hate a common enemy: I will thus espouse your hatred. I wanted Good: nonsense; on this earth and in these times, Good and Bad are inseparable: I accept to be evil in order to become good.","One is still what one is going to cease to be and already what one is going to become. One lives one's death, one dies one's life.","When you live alone you no longer know what it is to tell a story: the plausible disappears at the same time as the friends. You let events flow by too: you suddenly see people appear who speak and then go away; you plunge into stories of which you can't make head or tail: you'd make a terrible witness.","[Lost of the absolute] is in this sense that ''I no longer know what to do with my life\" must be understood. Critics have been mistaken about the meaning of this phrase, seeing in it a cry of despair as in Simone de Beauvoir's \"I have been cheated.\" When she uses this word it is to indicate that she claims from life an absolute which she cannot find there.","Uncalled-for aggression arouses the hatred of the civilian population.","I will take it all: tongs, molten lead, prongs, garrotes, all that burns, all that tears, I want to truly suffer. Better one hundred bites, better the whip, vitriol, than this suffering in the head, this ghost of suffering which grazes and caresses and never hurts enough.","One does not adopt a new idea, one slips into it.","There were days when you peered into yourself, into the secret places of your heart, and what you saw there made you faint with horror. And then, next day, you didn't know what to make of it,you couldn't interpret the horror you had glimpsed the day before. Yes, you know what evil costs.","Man must be invented each day","Intellectuals cannot be good revolutionaries; they are just good enough to be assassins.","As for the square at Meknes, where I used to go every day, it's even simpler: I do not see it at all anymore. All that remains is the vague feeling that it was charming, and these five words that are indivisibly bound together: a charming square at Meknes. ... I don't see anything any more: I can search the past in vain, I can only find these scraps of images and I am not sure what they represent, whether they are memories or just fiction.","It is certain that we cannot escape anguish, for we are anguish.","A madman's ravings are absurd in relation to the situation in which he finds himself, but not in relation to his madness.","A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes place in the most honorable form.","The viable jewels of life remain untouched when man forgets his vocation of searching for the truth of his existence.","What then did you expect when you unbound the gag that muted those black mouths? That they would chant your praises? Did you think that when those heads that our fathers had forcibly bowed down to the ground were raised again, you would find adoration in their eyes?","No finite point has meaning without an infinite reference point.","The coward makes himself cowardly, the hero makes himself heroic.","One can ask why the I has to appear in the cogito {Descartes’ argument “I think therefore I am.}, since the cogito, if used rightly, is the awareness of pure consciousness, not directed at any fact or action. In fact the I is not necessary here, since it is never united directly to consciousness. One can even imagine a pure and self-aware consciousness which thinks of itself as impersonal spontaneity.","To keep hope alive one must, in spite of all mistakes, horrors, and crimes, recognize the obvious superiority of the socialist camp.","I can receive nothing more from these tragic solitudes than a little empty purity.","The consciousness that says 'I am' is not the consciousness that thinks.","This is what I thought: for the most banal even to become an adventure, you must (and this is enough) begin to recount it. This is what fools people: a man is always a teller of tales, he sees everything that happens to him through them; and he tries to live his own life as if he were telling a story. But you have to choose: live or tell.","Man is condemned to be free","Nothingness lies coiled in the heart of being - like a worm.","It would be much better if I could only stop thinking. Thoughts are the dullest things. Duller than flesh. They stretch out and there's no end to them and they leave a funny taste in the mouth. Then there are words, inside the thoughts, unfinished words, a sketchy sentence which constantly returns...It goes, it goes ... and there's no end to it. It's worse than the rest because I feel responsible and have complicity in it. For example, this sort of painful rumination: I exist, I am the one who keeps it up. I.","Because the Nazi venom worked its way even into our thoughts, every accurate thought was a conquest; because an all-powerful police sought to force us into silence every word became as precious as a declaration of principle; because we were persecuted, each of our gestures carried the weight of a commitment.","As for me, I am mean: that means that I need the suffering of others to exist. A flame. A flame in their hearts. When I am all alone, I am extinguished.","Atheism is a cruel long term business, and I have gone through it to the end.","For the artist, the color, the bouquet, the tinkling of the spoon on the saucer, are things in the highest degree. He stops at the quality of the sound or the form. He returns to it constantly and is enchanted with it.","All that I know about my life, it seems, I have learned in books.","Yes, I am so free. And what a superb absence is my soul.","I wanted my own words. But the ones I use have dragged through I don't know how many consciences.","One should commit no stupidity twice, the variety of choice is, in the end, large enough.","This desire [to write] is rather strange all the same and is not without a certain \"cracked\" quality.","Acting is happy agony.","I have such a desire to sleep and am so much behind my sleep. A good night, one good night and all this nonsense will be swept away.","Handing over a bank note is enough to make a bicycle belong to me, but my entire life is needed to realize this possession.","Let it crumble! Let the rocks revile me and flowers wilt at my coming. Your whole universe is not enough to prove me wrong. You are the king of gods, king of stones and stars, king of the waves of the sea. But you are not the king of man.","We will not go to Heaven,Goetz, and even if we both entered it, we would not have eyes to see each other, nor hands to touch each other. Up there, God gets all the attention.... We can only love on this earth and against God.","I think that is the big danger in keeping a diary: you exaggerate everything.","I think there is an enormous diference between speaking and writing. One rereads what one writes. But one might read it slowly or quickly. In other words, you do not know how long you will have to spend deliberating over a sentence. ... But if I listen to a tape recorder, the listening time is determined by the speed at which the tape turns and not by my own needs.","I found the human heart empty and insipid everywhere except in books.","For the moment, the jazz is playing; there is no melody, just notes, a myriad tiny tremors. The notes know no rest, an inflexibleorder gives birth to them then destroys them, without ever leaving them the chance to recuperate and exist for themselves.... I would like to hole them back, but I know that, if I succeeded in stooping one, there would only remain in may hand a corrupt and languishing sound. I must accept their death; I must even want that death: I know of few more bitter or intense impressions.","But [your crime] will be there, one hundred times denied, always there, dragging itself behind you. Then you will finally know that you have committed your life with one throw of the die, once and for all, and there is nothing you can do but tug our crime along until your death. Such is the law, just and unjust, of repentance. Then we will see what will become of your young pride.","A man is always a teller of tales, he lives surrounded by his stories and the stories of others, he sees everything that happens to him through them; and he tries to live his life as if he were recounting it.","Being is. Being is in-itself. Being is what it is.","There are photographers who push for war because they make stories. They search for a Chinese who has a more Chinese are than the others and they end up finding one. They have him take a typically Chinese pose and surround him with chinoiseries. What have they captured on their film? A Chinese? Definitely not: the idea of the Chinese.","So that is what hell is. I would never have believed it. You remember: the fire and brimstone, the torture. Ah! the farce. There is no need for torture: Hell is other people.","When I can't see myself in the mirror, I can't even feel myself, and I begin to wonder if I exist at all.","It is therefore senseless to think of complaining since nothing foreign has decided what we feel, what we live, or what we are.","With despair, true optimism begins: the optimism of the man who expects nothing, who knows he has no rights and nothing coming to him, who rejoices in counting on himself alone and in acting alone for the good of all.","Take [Stéphane] Mallarme. I hold him to be the greatest of French poets, and I have taken some time to understand him !","What I ask of [the writer] is not to ignore the reality and the fundamental problems that exist. The world's hunger, the atomic threat, the alienation of man, I am astonished that they do not color all our literature.","That God does not exist, I cannot deny, That my whole being cries out for God I cannot forget.","You are -- your life, and nothing else.","You must be like me; you must suffer in rhythm.","Generosity is nothing else than a craze to possess. All which I abandon, all which I give, I enjoy in a higher manner through the fact that I give it away. To give is to enjoy possessively the object which one gives.","You take souls for vegetables.... The gardener can decide what will become of his carrots but no one can choose the good of others for them.","Objects should not touch because they are not alive. You use them, put them back in place, you live among them: they are useful, nothing more. But they touch me, it is unbearable. I am afraid of being in contact with them as though they were living beasts.","Don't you feel the same way? When I cannot see myself, even though I touch myself, I wonder if I really exist.","I construct my memories with my present. I am lost, abandoned in the present. I try in vain to rejoin the past: I cannot escape.","So much torture, bloodshed, deceit. You cannot make your young people practice torture twenty-four hours a day and not expect to pay a price for it.","Man is abandoned on earth in the midst of his infinite responsibilities, without help, with no aim but what he sets himself.","I had realized in the meantime that action too has its difficulties, and that one can also be led to it by neurosis. We are not saved by politics any more than by literature.","There is no human nature, since there is no god to conceive it.","What I regretted in La Nausee was not to have put myself completely into the thing. I remained outside my hero's disease, protected by my neurosis which, through writing, gave me happiness.","It is always more valuable to report the truth.","Thus it amounts to the same thing whether one gets drunk alone or is a leader of nations.","Philosophy appears to some people as a homogenous milieu: there thoughts are born and die, there systems are built, and there, in turn, they collapse. Others take Philosophy for a specific attitude which we can freely adopt at will. Still others see it as a determined segment of culture. In our view Philosophy does not exist.","We will freedom for freedom’s sake, in and through particular circumstances. And in thus willing freedom, we discover that it depends entirely upon the freedom of others and that the freedom of others depends upon our own. Obviously, freedom as the definition of a man does not depend upon others, but as soon as there is a commitment, I am obliged to will the liberty of others at the same time as my own. I cannot make liberty my aim unless I make that of others equally my aim.","To think new thoughts you have to break the bones in your head","There is a universe behind and before him. And the day is approaching when closing the last book on the last shelf on the far left; he will say to himself, \"now what?","Perhaps its inevitable, perhaps one has to choose between being nothing at all and impersonating what one is.","I needed to justify my existence, and I had made an absolute of literature. It took me thirty years to get rid of this state of mind.","Everything that exists is born for no reason, carries on living through weakness, and dies by accident","Is there really nothing, nothing left of me?","I was not the one to invent lies: they were created in a society divided by class and each of us inherited lies when we were born. It is not by refusing to lie that we will abolish lies: it is by eradicating class by any means necessary.","You know how much I admire Che Guevara. In fact, I believe that the man was not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age: as a fighter and as a man, as a\n theoretician who was able to further the cause of revolution by drawing his theories from his personal experience in battle.","I exist. It's sweet, so sweet, so slow. And light: you'd think it floated all by itself. It stirs. It brushes by me, melts and vanishes. Gently, gently. There is bubbling water in my mouth. I swallow. It slides down my throat, it caresses me — and now it comes up again into my mouth. For ever I shall have a little pool of whitish water in my mouth - lying low - grazing my tongue. And this pool is still me. And the tongue. And the throat is me.","I said to myself, 'I want to die decently'.","If I relegate impossible Salvation to the prop room, what remains? A whole man, composed of all men and as good as all of them and no better than any.","I have crossed the seas, I have left cities behind me, and I have followed the source of rivers towards their source or plunged into forests, always making for other cities. I have had women, I have fought with men ; and I could never turn back any more than a record can spin in reverse. And all that was leading me where ? To this very moment.","Fear? If I have gained anything by damning myself, it is that I no longer have anything to fear.","It is no longer possible to escape men. Farewell to the monsters, farewell to the saints. Farewell to pride. All that is left is men.","A man is involved in life, leaves his impress on it, and outside of that there is nothing.","My thought is me: that is why I cannot stop thinking. I exist because I think I cannot keep from thinking.","An individual chooses and makes himself.","To choose this or that is to affirm at the same time the value of what we choose, because we can never choose evil. We always choose the good, and nothing can be good for us without being\n good for all.","I am finishing a biography of [Gustave] Flaubert. Because he is the opposite of what I am. One needs to rub up against argument.","This is the basis for the joy of love when there is joy; we feel that our existence is justified.","Be quiet! Anyone can spit in my face, and call me a criminal and a prostitute. But no one has the right to judge my remorse.","A Soviet citizen, an official writer, once said to me: \"The day when Communism (that is, well-being for everyone) reigns, man's tragedy will begin: his finitude.\"","The world would get along very well without literature. It would get along even better without man.","Better a good journalist than a poor assassin.","If I did not publish this autobiography [Les Mots] sooner and in its most radical form, it is because I considered it exaggerated.","It answers the question that was tormenting you: my love, you are not 'one thing in my life' - not even the most important - because my life no longer belongs to me because...you are always me.","What's done at night belongs to the night. In the daytime you don't talk about it.","There it is: I am gently slipping into the water's depths, towards fear.","I committed the first crime by creating men as mortals. After that, what more could you do, you the murderers? Come on; they already had death in them: at most you simply hastened things a little.","The plight of modern man is that he is condemmed to be free.","Time is too large, it can't be filled up. Everything you plunge into it is stretched and disintegrates.","And I too wanted to be. That is all I wanted; and this is the last word. At the bottom of all these attempts which seemed without bounds, I find the same desire again: to drive existence out of me, to rid the passing moments of their fat, to twist them, dry them, purify myself, harden myself, to give back at last the sharp, precise sound of a saxophone note. That could even make an apologue: there was a poor man who got in the wrong world.","All I want is' - and he uttered the final words through clenched teeth and with a sort of shame - 'to retain my freedom.' I should myself have thought,' said Jacques, 'that freedom consisted in frankly confronting situations into which one had deliberately entered, and accepting all one's responsibilities. But that, no doubt, is not your view.","There is no salvation anywhere. The idea of salvation implies the idea of an absolute.","Absurd, irreducible; nothing — not even a profound and secret delirium of nature — could explain it. Obviously I did not know everything, I had not seen the seeds sprout, or the tree grow. But faced with this great wrinkled paw, neither ignorance nor knowledge was important: the world of explanations and reasons is not the world of existence. A circle is not absurd, it is clearly explained by the rotation of a straight segment around one of its extremities. But neither does a circle exist. This root, on the other hand, existed in such a way that I could not explain it.","Everything is gratuitous, this garden, this city and myself. When you suddenly realize it, it makes you feel sick and everything begins to drift . . . that's nausea.","The sun is not ridiculous, quite the contrary. On everything I like, on the rust of the construction girders, on the rotten boards of the fence, a miserly, uncertain light falls, like the look you give, after a sleepless night, on decisions made with enthusiasm the day before, on pages you have written in one spurt without crossing out a word.","The lad who dreams of being a boxing champion or an admiral chooses reality. If the writer chooses the imaginary, he confuses the two.","As if there could be true stories: things happen in one way, and we retell them in the opposite way.","Outside nature, against nature, without excuse, beyond remedy, except what remedy I find within myself.","I am not virtuous. Our sons will be if we shed enough blood to give them the right to be.","I am not recommending \"popular\" literature which aims at the lowest.","The more absurd life is, the more insupportable death is.","If literature isn't everything, it's not worth a single hour of someone's trouble.","Nicias, do you think you can erase with good deeds the wrongs you committed against your mother? What good deed will ever reach her? Her soul is a scorching noon time, without a single breath of a breeze, nothing moves, nothing changes, nothing lives there; a great emaciated sun, an immobile sun eternally consumes her.","If you begin by saying, 'Thou shalt not lie,' there is no longer any possibility of political action.","If a Jew is fascinated by Christians it is not because of their virtues, which he values little, but because they represent anonymity, humanity without race.","Originally, poetry creates the myth, while the prose-writer draws its portrait.","it was odd, he thought, that a man could hate himself as though he were someone else.","I discovered suddenly that alienation, exploitation of man by man, under-nourishment, relegated to the background metaphysical evil which is a luxury.","When one loves animals and children too much, one loves them against human beings.","Neither sex, without some fertilization of the complimentary characters of the other, is capable of the highest reaches of human endeavor.","For an occurrence to become an adventure, it is necessary and sufficient for one to recount it.","The existentialist says at once that man is anguish.","Un homme n'est rien d'autre qu'une se  rie d'entreprises. A man is no other than a series of undertakings.","L'homme est condamne   a'   e\"  tre libre. Man is condemned to be free.","Freedom is existence, and in it existence precedes essence.","The writer is committed when he plunges to the very depths of himself with the intent to disclose, not his individuality, but his person in the complex society that conditions and supports him.","Your scare me rather. My reflection in the glass never did that; of course, I knew it so well. Like something I had tamed...I'm going to smile, and my smile will sink down into your pupils, and heaven knows what it will become.","For the time being I have seen enough of living things, of dogs, of men, of all flabby masses which move spontaneously.","A writer who takes political, social or literary positions must act only with the means that are his. These means are the written words.","I have seen children dying of hunger. Over against a dying child La Nausee cannot act as a counterweight.","That is exactly the writer's problem. What does literature stand for in a hungry world?","Respectable society believed in God in order to avoid having to speak about him.","Men equally honest, equally devoted to their fatherland, are momentarily separated by different conceptions of their duty.","She suffers as a miser. She must be miserly with her pleasures, as well. I wonder if sometimes she doesn't wish she were free of this monotonous sorrow, of these mutterings which start as soon as she stops singing, if she doesn't wish to suffer once and for all, to drown herself in despair. In any case, it would be impossible for her: she is bound.","Existence is an imperfection.","Like morality, literature needs to be universal. So that the writer must put himself on the side of the majority, of the two billion starving, if he wishes to be able to speak to all and be read by all. Failing that, he is at the service of a privileged class and, like it, an exploiter.","I wanted the moments of my life to follow and order themselves like those of a life remembered. You might as well try and catch time by the tail.","Torture is senseless violence, born in fear... torture costs human lives but does not save them. We would almost be too lucky if these crimes were the work of savages: the truth is that torture makes torturers.","There is no love apart from the deeds of love; no potentiality of love other than that which is manifested in loving.","I am responsible for everything... except my very responsibility.","He is always becoming, and if it were not for the contingency of death, he would never end.","Better to have beasts that let themselves be killed than men who run away.","The universe remains dark. We are animals struck by catastrophe.","It is better; heavier, crueler. The mouth you wear for hell.","Who can exhaust a man? Who knows a man's resources?","So long as one believes in God, one has the right to do the Good in order to be moral.","The characteristic of every neurosis is to represent itself as natural.","What is not possible is not to choose.","Ha! to forget. How childish! I feel you in my bones. Your silence screams in my ears. You may nail your mouth shut, you may cut out your tongue, can you keep yourself from existing? Will you stop your thoughts.","I maintain that inversion is the effect of neither a prenatal choice nor an endocrinal malformation nor even the passive and determined result of complexes. It is an outlet that a child discovers when he is suffocating.","To whomever gives a kiss or a blow\nRender a kiss or blow\nBut to whomever gives when you are unable to return\nOffer all the hatred in your heart\nFor you were slaves and he enslaves you","It is enough that one man hate another for hate to gain, little by little, all mankind.","To be responsible is to be the uncontested author of an event or thing.","At times discreetly, at times disgustingly, I yielded to the most fatal temptation whenever I could no longer bear it: as a result of impatience, Orpheus lost Eurydice; as a result of impatience, I lost myself.","I have nothing but contempt for you idiotic chosen ones who have the heart to rejoice when there are the damned in Hell and the poor on earth; as for me, I am on the side of men and I will not leave it.","Anything, anything would be better than this agony of mind, this creeping pain that gnaws and fumbles and caresses one and never hurts quite enough.","I wrote in Les Mots that \"I have often thought against myself.\" That sentence has not been\nunderstood either. Critics have seen in it a confession of masochism. But that is how one\nshould think: revolting against everything \"inculcated'' that one may have within oneself.","Criticism often takes from the tree caterpillars and blossoms together.","Words There is no good father, that's the rule. Don't lay the blame on men but on the bond of paternity, which is rotten. To beget children, nothing better; to have them, what iniquity!","I do not understand! I understand nothing! I cannot understand nor do I want to understand! I want to believe! To Believe!","What never vary are the necessities of being in the world, of having to labor and to die there.","Listen to me: a family man is never a real family man. An assassin is never entirely assassin. They play a role, you understand. While a dead man, he is really dead. To be or not to be, right?","The real nature of the present revealed itself: it was what exists, all that was not present did not exist.","Hell is for other people.","I entered the Communist Party because its cause was just and I will leave it when it ceases to be just.","She smiled and said with an ecstatic air: \"It shines like a little diamond\", \"What does?\" \"This moment. It is round, it hangs in empty space like a little diamond; I am eternal.","In order to make myself recognized by the Other, I must risk my own life. To risk one's life, in fact, is to reveal oneself as not-bound to the objective form or to any determined existence\n — as not-bound to life.","I have changed as everyone changes: within a permanency.","A man who is free is like a mangy sheep in a herd. He will contaminate my entire kingdom and ruin my work.","Man's existence precedes his essence","I admire [Samuel] Beckett, but I am totally against him. He seeks no improvement.","In Guinea I could read [Franz] Kafka. I re-discover in him my own discomfort.","I grow warm, I begin to feel happy. There is nothing extraordinary in this, it is a small happiness of Nausea: it spreads at the bottom of the viscous puddle, at the bottom of out time - the time of purple suspenders, and broken chair seats; it is made of white, soft instants, spreading at the edge, like an oil stain. No sooner than born, it is already old, it seems as though I have known it for twenty years.","As long as the writer cannot write for the two billion men who are hungry, he will be oppressed by a feeling of malaise.","[Stéphane Mallarmé] theory of the hermetic is a mistake, but he can be only difficult to read when he has difficult things to say.","It's just what people do when they're getting old, when they're sick of themselves and their life; they think of money and take care of themselves.","What do I care about Jupiter? Justice is a human issue, and I do not need a god to teach it to me.","But I must finally realize that I am subject to these sudden transformations. The thing is that I rarely think; a crowd of small metamorphoses accumulate in me without my noticing it, and then, one fine day, a veritable revolution takes place.","I am not asking for sensational revelations, but I would like to sense the meaning of that minute, to feel it's urgency.","Then I realized what separated us: what I thought about him could not reach him; it was psychology, the kind they write about in books. But his judgment went through me like a sword and questioned my very right to exist. And it was true, I had always realized it; I hadn't the right to exist. I had appeared by chance, I existed like a stone, a plant or a microbe. My life put out feelers towards small pleasures in every direction. Sometimes it sent out vague signals; at other times I felt nothing more than a harmless buzzing.","The revolution you dream of is not ours. You don't want to change the world; you want to blow it up.","A writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution.","It is too early to love. We will buy the right to do so by shedding blood.","emotion is first of all and in principle an accident","I am alone in this white, garden-rimmed street. Alone and free. But this freedom is rather like death.","When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die.","From the period when I wrote La Nausea I wanted to create a morality. My evolution consists in my no longer dreaming of doing so.","What I see is teeming cohesion, contained dispersal... For him, to sculpt is to take the fat off space.","One always dies too soon or too late. And yet, life is there, finished: the line is drawn, and it must all be added up. You are nothing other than your life.","So it comes to this; one doesn’t need rest. Why bother about sleep if one isn’t sleepy? That stands to reason, doesn’t it? Wait a minute, there’s a snag somewhere; something disagreeable. Why, now, should it be disagreeable? …Ah, I see; it’s life without a break.","I clung to nothing, in a way I was calm. But it was a horrible calm—because of my body; my body, I saw with its eyes, I heard with its ears, but it was no longer me; it sweated and trembled by itself and I didn’t recognize it any more.","Existence is prior to essence.","Ah! yes, I know: those who see me rarely trust my word: I must look too intelligent to keep it.","That of War and Peace or of Almagestes. All are satisfactory. The only criterion of a work\nis its validity: that it should grip and that it should last.","[Andre] Gide can say it to me: it is a writer's morality only addressed to a few privileged\npeople. For that reason it no longer interests me.","Existence is not something which lets itself be thought of form a distance; it must invade you suddenly, master you, weigh heavily on your heart like a great motionless beast - or else there is nothing at all.","Existence precedes and rules essence.","The public, too, has to make an effort in order to understand the writer who, though he renounce complacent obscurity, cannot always express his new-hidden thoughts lucidly and according to accepted models.","You see, I'm fond of teasing, it's a second nature with me—and I'm used to teasing myself. Plaguing myself, if you prefer; I don't tease nicely.","First all men must be able to become men by the improvement of their conditions of existence, so that a universal morality can be created. If I begin by saying to them: \"Thou\nshalt not lie,\" there is no longer any possibility of political action. What matters first is the liberation of man.","For forty years I was conscripted by the absolute, the neurosis. The absolute is gone. There remain countless tasks among which literature is in no way privileged.","I have always been an optimist, perhaps even too much.","I must be without remorse or regrets as I am without excuse; for from the instant of my upsurge into being, I carry the weight of the world by myself alone without help, engaged in a world for which I bear the whole responsibility without being able, whatever I do, to tear myself away from this responsibility for an instant.","I am myself and I am here.","We do not wish to say only that a man is responsible for his own individuality, but that he is responsible for that of all men.","Some of these days, Oh, you'll miss me honey","Do you think I can read [Alain] Robbe-Grillet in an underdeveloped country? He does not feel himself maimed.","All-powerful god, who am I but the fear that I inspire in others?","Love or hatred calls for self-surrender. He cuts a fine figure, the warm-blooded, prosperous man, solidly entrenched in his well-being, who one fine day surrenders all to love—or to hatred; himself, his house, his land, his memories.","You see, the contemporary writer must write through his intimations of unease, while trying to elucidate them.","The For-itself, in fact, is nothing but the pure nihilation of the In-itself; it is like a hole of being at the heart of Being.","I have always been happy. Even if I had been more honest with regard to myself at that moment I should still have written La Nausee.","Things are entirely what they appear to be and behind them... there is nothing.","Thrown into the atmosphere of action [in 1954], I suddenly understood the kind of neurosis that dominated all my previous work. I had not been able to recognize it before: I was inside. Simone de Beauvoir had guessed these reasons before I did.","To eat is to appropriate by destruction.","In Les Mots I explain the origin of my madness, of my neurosis. This analysis may help the young who dream of writing.","In a country lacking leaders, in Africa, for instance, how could a native educated in Europe refuse to become a professor, even at the price of his literary vocation?","One could only damage oneself through the harm one did to others. One could never get directly at oneself.","This then is the age of reason.","Abjection is a methodological conversion, like Cartesian doubt and Husserlian epoche: it establishes the world as a closed system which consciousness regards from without, in the manner of divine understanding.","Absurd, irreducible; nothing--not even a profound and secret delirium of nature--could explain [a tree root].","Happiness has to be installed in each person as a state of affairs completely cut off from the process that brought it about and, in particular, from the real situation. Man has to be affected with happiness. It is a tonality given to him. Contradiction: if one does take care to give him happiness, it is because he is a free creature--but in order to give it to him, one turns him into an object.","To love is never just to love since it is also to will to love, and ... to love in spite of oneself, to allow oneself to be overcome by one's love.","In the nineteenth century one had to give all sorts of guarantees and lead an exemplary life in order to cleanse oneself in the eyes of the bourgeois of the sin of writing, for literature is, in essence, heresy. The situation has not changed except that it is now the Communists, that is, the qualified representatives of the proletariat, who as a matter of principle regard the writer as suspect.","My eyes feel all soft, all soft as flesh. I'm going to sleep.","I’ve dropped out of their hearts like a little sparrow fallen from its nest. So gather me up, dear, fold me to your heart – and you’ll see how nice I can be.","For common minds have an ugly ability to perceive in the deepest and richest saying nothing but their own everyday opinion.","In any case, if you ever leave me with a handsome man, do not tell me that you trust me because, let me warn you: that is not what will prevent me from deceiving you, if I want to. On the contrary.","God is the solitude of men. There was only me: I alone decided to commit Evil; alone, I invented Good. I am the one who cheated, I am the one who performed miracles, I am the one accusing myself today, I alone can absolve myself; me, the man.","Heroism is not to be won at the point of a pen.","The painful secret of gods and kings is that men are free, Aegistheus. You know it and they do not.","It is not a matter of indifference whether we like oysters or clams, snails or shrimp, if only we know how to unravel the existential significance of these foods.","Remember, Orestes: you were part of my herd, you grazed in the fields along with my sheep. Your liberty is nothing but a mange eating away at you, it is nothing but an exile.","I am neither virgin nor priest enough to play with the inner life.","I consider Les Nourritures Terrestres as a frightening book: \"Look for God in no other place than everywhere.\" Go and tell that to a workman, an engineer!","Many young people today do not concern themselves with style. They think that what one says should be said simply and that is all. For me, style - which does not exclude simplicity, quite the opposite - is above all a way of saying three or four things in one. There is the simple sentence, with its immediate meaning, and then at the same time, below this immediate meaning, other meanings are organized. If one is not capable of giving language this plurality of meaning, then it is not worth the trouble to write.","There is no book of mine that I reject. That does not mean that I find them good.","A pale reflection of myself wavers in my consciousness...and suddenly the “I” pales, pales, and fades out.","Night is falling: at dusk, you must have good eyesight to be able to tell the Good Lord from the Devil.","I do not give a damn about the dead. They died for the [Communist] Party and the Party can decide what it wants. I practice a live man's politics, for the living.","It is not right, my fellow-countrymen, you who know very well all the crimes committed in our name. It's not at all right that you do not breathe a word about them to anyone, not even to your own soul, for fear of having to stand in judgment of yourself. I am willing to believe that at the beginning you did not realize what was happening; later, you doubted whether such things could be true; but now you know, and still you hold your tongues.","Life is a useless passion.","Man is always a wizard to man, and the social world is at first magical.","When my relations with the Communist Party gave me the necessary perspective I decided to write my autobiography. I wanted to show how a man can pass from literature held sacred to action which nevertheless remains that of an intellectual.","I had dreamed my life for nearly fifty years (I am about to be fifty-nine). But, you see,\nthere are two tones in Les Mats: the echo of this condemnation and a mitigation of that severity.","Therefore, in the nature of this will for freedom, which freedom itself implies, I may pass judgement on those who seek to hide from themselves the complete arbitrariness and the complete freedom of their existence.","I was a neophyte in another world [in 1954].","I was escaping from Nature and at last becoming myself, that Other whom I was aspiring to be in the eyes of others.","On my way to the office in the morning, there are, in front of me, behind me, other men going to their jobs. I see them; if I dared, I would smile at them. I think to myself that I am a socialist, that they are the purpose of my life, of my efforts and that they do not know it yet.","I believe, I desire, that social and economic ills may be remedied.","Il n'y a pas d'autre univers qu'un univers humain, l'univers de la subjectivite   humaine. There is no other universe except the human universe, the universe of human subjectivity.","A human being who wakened in the morning with a queesy stomach, with fifteen hours to kill before next bedtime, had not much use for freedom.","I considered calmly that I was born to write.","Never have I thought that I was the happy possessor of a \"talent;\" my sole concern has been to save myself by work and faith.","The [Communist] Party has one objective: the creation of a socialist economy; and one means: the utilization of the class struggle.","L'homme est une passion inutile. Man is a useless passion.","What do you want to do with the [Communist] Party? A racing stable? What good is it to sharpen a knife every day if you never useit for slicing? A party is never more than a means. There is only one objective: power.","Perception is naturally surpassed toward action; better yet, it can be revealed only in and through projects of action. The world is revealed as an \"always future hollow\", for we are always future to ourselves.","It is the same: a chosen one is a man whom God's finger crushes against the wall.","But for me there is neither Monday nor Sunday: there are days which pass in disorder, and then, sudden lightning like this one. Nothing has changed and yet everything is different. I can't describe it, it's like the Nausea and yet it's just the opposite: at last an adventure happens to me and when I question myself I see that it happens that I am myself and that I am here; I am the one who splits in the night, I am as happy as the hero of a novel.","I had been playing with matches and burned a small rug. I was in the process of covering up my crime when suddenly God saw me. I felt His gaze inside my head and on my hands....I flew into a rage against so crude an indiscretion, I blasphemed....He never looked at me again....I had the more difficulty getting rid of Him the Holy Ghost in that He had installed Himself at the back of my head....I collared the Holy Ghost in the cellar and threw Him out.","The appearance of the other in the world corresponds therefore to a congealed sliding of the whole universe.","I do not feel that I am the product of chance, a speck of dust in the universe, but someone who was expected, prepared, prefigured. In short, a being whom only a Creator could put here; and this idea of a creating hand refers to God.","I know. I know that I shall never again meet anything or anybody who will inspire me with passion. You know, it's quite a job starting to love somebody. You have to have energy, generosity, blindness. There is even a moment, in the very beginning, when you have to jump across a precipice: if you think about it you don't do it. I know I'll never jump again.","Ah! How I hate the crimes of the new generation: they are dry and sterile as darnel.","All the same, they [books] do serve some purpose. Culture doesn't save anything or anyone, it doesn't justify. But it's a product of man: he projects himself into it, he recognizes himself in it; that critical mirror alone offers him his image.","Once liberty has exploded in the soul of a man, the gods can do nothing against that man.","Understand me: I wish to be a man from somewhere, a man among men. You see, a slave, when he passes by, weary and surly, carrying a heavy load, limping along and looking down at his feet, only at his feet to avoid falling down; he is in his town, like a leaf in greenery, like a tree in a forest, argos surrounds him, heavy and warm, full of herself; I want to be that slave, Electra, I want to pull the city around me and to roll myself up in it like a blanket. I will not leave.","Ah! Do not judge the gods, young man, they have painful secrets.","Good digestions, the gray monotony of provincial life, and the boredom-ah the soul-destroying boredom-of long days of mild content.","Man exists, turns up, appears on the scene and only afterwards, defines himself","Generally speaking there is no irreducible taste or inclination. They all represent a certain appropriative choice of being. It is up to existential psychoanalysis to compare and classify\nthem. Ontology abandons us here; it has merely enabled us to determine the ultimate ends of human reality, its fundamental possibilities, and the value which haunts it.","Everything in my past, in my training, everything that has been most essential in my activity up to now has made me above all a man who writes, and it is too late for that to change.","Man is always separated from what he is by all the breadth of the being which he is not. He makes himself known to himself from the other side of the world and he looks from the horizon\n toward himself to recover his inner being.","The past is the luxury of proprietors.","Criminals together. We're in hell, my little friend, and there's never any mistake there. People are not damned for nothing.","Either the USSR was not the country of socialism, in which case socialism didn't exist anywhere and doubtless, wasn't possible: or else, socialism was that, this abominable monster, this police state, the power of beasts of prey.","If you are not already dead, forgive. Rancor is heavy, it is worldly; leave it on earth: die light.","Some men are born committed to action: they do not have a choice, they have been thrown on a path, at the end of that path, an act awaits them, their act.","Aegistheus, the kings have another secret.... Once liberty has exploded in the soul of a man, the Gods can do nothing against that man. It is a matter for men to handle amongst themselves, and it is up to other men and to them alone to let him flee or to destroy him.","The status of 'native' is a nervous condition introduced and maintained by the settler among colonized people with their consent.","I distrust the incommunicable; it is the source of all violence","A good hanging now and then -- that entertains folk in the provinces and robs death of its glamour.","I know only one Church: it is the society of men.","I am a man, Jupiter, and each man must invent his own path.","Lord, you have cursed Cain and Cain’s children: thy will be done. You have allowed men’s hearts to be corrupted, that their intentions be rotten, that their actions putrefy and stink: thy will be done.","I receive letters from workers, from secretaries. . . . They are the most interesting ones.","The recent experiences of pocketbooks prove this. I have changed my public since my works have been published in a smaller format.","At that time [1954], as a result of political events, I was deeply preoccupied by my relations with the Communist Party.","Besides one should not believe that the people only want reading that is easy to absorb.","Total war is no longer war waged by all members of one national community against all those of another. It is total... because it may well involve the whole world.","What I lacked [in La Nausee] was a sense of reality. I have changed since. I have slowly learned to experience reality.","I don't know. Everything. Living. Smoking.","Through the lack of attaching myself to words, my thoughts remain nebulous most of the time. They sketch vague, pleasant shapes and then are swallowed up; I forget them almost immediately.","Little flashes of sun on the surface of a cold, dark sea.","I enjoy feeling fastidious and aloof. I enjoy saying no, always no, and I should be afraid of any attempt to construct a finally habitable world, because I should merely have to say - Yes; and act like other people.","My pessimism has never been flabby.","With a little luck that epoch may arrive. I am on the side of those who think that things will go better when the world has changed.","I think [Alain Robbe-Grillet] a good writer, but he speaks to the comfortable bourgeoisie.","The form [of literature] matters little to me, classical or not.","I say a murder is abstract. You pull the trigger and after that you do not understand anything that happens.","I should wish [Alain Robbe-Grillet] to realize that Guinea exists.","[Contemporary writer] could be a kind of [Samuel] Beckett who would not be felt to be totally committed to despair.","This [service to oppressed] is the writer's task, and, if he fulfills it as he should, he acquires no merit from it.","The way, applicable in our non-revolutionary societies, to prepare for the time when everyone will read, is to pose problems in the most radical and intransigent manner. This is what Alain Badiou has just done in Almagestes, where he puts language on trial with an intention\nof cleansing, of catharsis.","All human actions are equivalent... and all are on principle doomed to failure.","In the state I was in, if someone had come and told me I could go home quietly, that they would leave me my life whole, it would have left me cold: several hours or several years of waiting is all the same when you have lost the illusion of being eternal.","If you're lonely when you're alone, you're in bad company.","Do you think that I count the days? There is only one day left, always starting over: it is given to us at dawn and taken away from us at dusk.","Hell is—other people!","Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does. It is up to you to give [life] a meaning.","Freedom is what we do with what is done to us.","Better to die on one's feet than to live on one's knees.","When the rich wage war it's the poor who die.","She believed in nothing. Only her scepticism kept her from being an atheist.","Like all dreamers I confuse disenchantment with truth.","Life has no meaning a priori… It is up to you to give it a meaning, and value is nothing but the meaning that you choose.","The more sand that has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we should see through it.","So this is hell.

Hell is—other people!","This is what I thought: for the most banal even to become an adventure, you must (and this is enough) begin to recount it. This is what fools people: a man is always a teller of tales, he sees everything that happens to him through them; and he tries to live his own life as if he were telling a story.But you have to choose: live or tell.","She smiled and said with an ecstatic air: \"It shines like a little diamond\",\"What does?\"\"This moment. It is round, it hangs in empty space like a little diamond; I am eternal.","Il n'y a de réalité que dans l'action.(There is no reality except in action.)","I have crossed the seas, I have left cities behind me,and I have followed the source of rivers towards theirsource or plunged into forests, always making for othercities.

And all that was leading me where ?To this very moment...","Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.","You and me are real people, operating in a real world. We are not figments of each other’s imagination. I am the architect of my own self, my own character and destiny. It is no use whingeing about what I might have been, I am the things I have done and nothing more. We are all free, completely free. We can each do any damn thing we want. Which is more than most of us dare to imagine.","I never could bear the idea of anyone's expecting something from me. Italways made me want to do just the opposite.","L'enfer, c'est les autres.","There is only one day left, always starting over: It is given to us at dawn and taken away from us at dusk.","Man is condemned to be free. Condemned because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment he is thrown into this world he is responsible for everything he does.","You know, it's quite a job starting to love somebody. You have to have energy, generosity, blindness. There is even a moment, in the very beginning, when you have to jump across a precipice: if you think about it you don't do it.","One always dies too soon — or too late. And yet one’s whole life is complete at that moment, with a line drawn neatly under it, ready for the summing up. You are — your life, and nothing else.","نعمةٌ كبرى أن تكون وألا تكون، فأقصى درجات الحرية ألا تكون لافتًا للعين أو للأذن، تقول ما يعجبك ولا يحاسبك أحد، كأنك وحدك في الدنيا أو كأنك صنعت الدنيا على مزاجك، جعلت كل الناس خدامين السيادة ونزعت لسان كل واحد منهم وفقأت عينه وسددت أذنيه، ثم قلت وفعلت ما بدا لك، فلا أحد يحاسبك.","For many have but one resource to sustain them in their misery, and that is to think, “Circumstances have been against me, I was worthy to be something much better than I have been. I admit I have never had a great love or a great friendship; but that is because I never met a man or a woman who were worthy of it; if I have not written any very good books, it is because I had not the leisure to do so; or, if I have had no children to whom I could devote myself it is because I did not find the man I could have lived with. So there remains within me a wide range of abilities, inclinations and potentialities, unused but perfectly viable, which endow me with a worthiness that could never be inferred from the mere history of my actions. But in reality and for the existentialist, there is no love apart from the deeds of love; no potentiality of love other than that which is manifested in loving; there is no genius other than that which is expressed in works of art.”","I jump up: it would be much better if I could only stop thinking. Thoughts are the dullest things. Duller than flesh. They stretch out and there's no end to them and they leave a funny taste in the mouth. Then there are words, inside the thoughts, unfinished words, a sketchy sentence which constantly returns: \"I have to fi. . . I ex. . . Dead . . . M. de Roll is dead . . . I am not ... I ex. . .\" It goes, it goes . . . and there's no end to it. It's worse than the rest because I feel responsible and have complicity in it. For example, this sort of painful rumination: I exist, I am the one who keeps it up. I. The body lives by itself once it has begun. But though I am the one who continues it, unrolls it. I exist. How serpentine is this feeling of existing, I unwind it, slowly. ... If I could keep myself from thinking! I try, and succeed: my head seems to fill with smoke . . . and then it starts again: \"Smoke . . . not to think . . . don't want to think ... I think I don't want to think. I mustn't think that I don't want to think. Because that's still a thought.\" Will there never be an end to it?My thought is me: that's why I can't stop. I exist because I think . . . and I can't stop myself from thinking. At this very moment, it's frightful, if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing. I am the one who pulls myself from the nothingness to which I aspire: the hatred, the disgust of existing, there are as many ways to make myself exist, to thrust myself into existence. Thoughts are born at the back of me, like sudden giddiness, I feel them being born behind my head ... if I yield, they're going to come round in front of me, between my eyes, and I always yield, the thought grows and grows and there it is, immense, filling me completely and renewing my existence.","الآخرون هم الجحيم","Life has no meaning, the moment you lose the illusion of being eternal.","I dreamed vaguely of killing myself to wipe out at least one of these superfluous lives. But even my death would have been In the way. In the way, my corpse, my blood on these stones, between these plants, at the back of this smiling garden. And the decomposed flesh would have been In the way in the earth which would receive my bones, at last, cleaned, stripped, peeled, proper and clean as teeth, it would have been In the way: I was In the way for eternity.","I wanted my own words. But the ones I use have been dragged through I don't know how many consciences.","I do not think, therefore I am a moustache","Existence is not something which lets itself be thought of from a distance; it must invade you suddenly, master you, weigh heavily on your heart like a great motionless beast - or else there is nothing at all.","I looked anxiously around me: the present, nothing but the present. Furniture light and solid, rooted in its present, a table, a bed, a closet with a mirror-and me. the true nature of the present revealed itself: it was what exists, and all that was not present did not exist. The past did not exist. Not at all. Not in things, not even in my thoughts. It is true that I had realized a long time ago that mine had escaped me. But until then I had believed that it had simply gone out of my range. For me the past was only a pensioning off: it was another way of existing, a state of vacation and inaction; each event, when it had played its part, put itself politely into a box and became an honorary event: we have so much difficulty imagining nothingness. Now I knew: things are entirely what they appear to be-and behind them... there is nothing.","Death is a continuation of my life without me...","INEZ: Prove it. Prove it was no dream.

But if the entire regime, even your nonviolent thoughts, is governed by a thousand-year old oppression, your passiveness serves no other purpose but to put you on the side of the oppressors.","The absurd man will not commit suicide; he wants to live, without relinquishing any of his certainty, without a future, without hope, without illusions … and without resignation either. He stares at death with passionate attention and this fascination liberates him. He experiences the “divine irresponsibility of the condemned man.”","People. You must love people. Men are admirable. I wantto vomit—and suddenly, there it is: the Nausea","People are like dice. We throw ourselves in the direction of our own choosing.","What is important is not what happens to us, but how we respond to what happens to us.","All men are Prophets or else God does not exist.","It is the reflection of my face. Often in these lost days I study it: I can understand nothing of this face. The faces of others have some sense, some direction. Not mine. I cannot even decide whether it is handsome or ugly. I think it is ugly because I have been told so. But it doesn't strike me. At heart, I am even shocked that anyone can attribute qualities of this kind to it, as if you called a clod of earth or a block of stone beautiful or ugly.","There is no reality except in action. Man is nothing else than his plan; he exists only to the extent that he fulfills himself; he is therefore nothing else than the ensemble of his acts, nothing else than his life.","Most of the time, because of their failure to fasten on to words, my thoughts remain misty and nebulous. They assume vague, amusing shapes and are then swallowed up: I promptly forget them.","What if something were to happen? What if something suddenly started throbbing? Then they would notice it was there and they'd think their hearts were going to burst. Then what good would their dykes, bulwarks, power houses, furnaces and pile drivers be to them? It can happen any time, perhaps right now: the omens are present. For example, the father of a family might go out for a walk, and, across the street, he'll see something like a red rag, blown towards him by the wind. And when the rag has gotten close to him he'll see that it is a side of rotten meat, grimy with dust, dragging itself along by crawling, skipping, a piece of writhing flesh rolling in the gutter, spasmodically shooting out spurts of blood. Or a mother might look at her child's cheek and ask him: \"What's that, a pimple?\" and see the flesh puff out a little, split, open, and at the bottom of the split an eye, a laughing eye might appear. Or they might feel things gently brushing against their bodies, like the caresses of reeds to swimmers in a river. And they will realize that their clothing has become living things. And someone else might feel something scratching in his mouth. He goes to the mirror, opens his mouth: and his tongue is an enormous, live centipede, rubbing its legs together and scraping his palate. He'd like to spit it out, but the centipede is a part of him and he will have to tear it out with his own hands. And a crowd of things will appear for which people will have to find new names, stone eye, great three cornered arm, toe crutch, spider jaw. And someone might be sleeping in his comfortable bed, in his quiet, warm room, and wake up naked on a bluish earth, in a forest of rustling birch trees, rising red and white towards the sky like the smokestacks of Jouxtebouville, with big bumps half way out of the ground, hairy and bulbous like onions. And birds will fly around these birch trees and pick at them with their beaks and make them bleed. Sperm will flow slowly, gently, from these wounds, sperm mixed with blood, warm and glassy with little bubbles.","The Nausea has not left me and I don't believe it will leave me so soon; but I no longer have to bear it, it is no longer an illness or a passing fit: it is I.","Something is beginning in order to end: adventure does not let itself be drawn out; it only makes sense when dead. I am drawn, irrevocably, towards this death which is perhaps mine as well. Each instant appears only as part of a sequence. I cling to each instant with all my heart: I know that it is unique, irreplaceable -- and yet I would not raise a finger to stop it from being annihilated. This last moment I am spending -- in Berlin, in London -- in the arms of a woman casually met two days ago -- moment I love passionately, woman I may adore -- all is going to end, I know it. Soon I shall leave for another country. I shall never rediscover either this woman or this night. I grasp at each second, trying to suck it dry: nothing happens which I do not seize, which I do not fix forever in myself, nothing, neither the fugitive tenderness of those lovely eyes, nor the noises of the street, nor the false dawn of early morning: and even so the minute passes and I do not hold it back, I like to see it pass.","كانت حياتي كلها أمامي مغلقة كالحقيبة ومع ذلك فكل شيء بداخلها قد انتهى امره في لحظة، وكنت اريد ان اقتنع بأنها حياة جميلة ولكنني لم اوفق على هذا الحكم، كان مجرد صورة تخطيطية سريعة، لقد قضيت حياتي أصارع الأبدية..لم افهم شيئاً..لم انسى شيئاً..كان من الممكن ان انسى اشياء كثيرة.ــ الحائط","It’s strange. I felt less lonely when I didn’t know you.","I am not asking for sensational revelations, but I would like to sense the meaning of that minute, to feel it's urgency...","But everything changes when you tell about life; it's a change no one notices: the proof is that people talk about true stories. As if there could possibly be true stories; things happen one way and we tell about them in the opposite sense. You seem to start at the beginning: \"It was a fine autumn eveningin 1922.\" And in reality you have started at the end. It was there, invisible and present, it is the one which gives to words the pomp and value of a beginning... And the story goes on in reverse: instants have stopped piling themselves in a lighthearted way one on top of the other, they are snapped up by the end of the story which draws them and each one of them in turn, draws out the preceding instant: \"It was night, the street was deserted.\" The phrase is cast out negligently, it seems superfluous; but we do not let ourselves be caught and we put it aside: this is a piece of information whose value we shall subsequently appreciate. And we feel that the hero has lived all the details of this night like annunciations, promises, or even that he lived only those that were promises, blind and deaf to all that did not herald adventure. We forget that the future was not yet there; the man was walking in a night without forethought, a night which offered him a choice of dull rich prizes, and he did not make his choice. I wanted the moments of my life to follow and order themselves like those of a life remembered. You might as well try and catch time by the tail.","Tonight I love you in a way that you have not known in me: I am neither worn down by travels nor wrapped up in the desire for your presence. I am mastering my love for you and turning it inwards as a constituent element of myself. This happens much more often than I admit to you, but seldom when I’m writing to you. Try to understand me: I love you while paying attention to external things. At Toulouse I simply loved you. Tonight I love you on a spring evening. I love you with the window open. You are mine, and things are mine, and my love alters the things around me and the things around me alter my love.","Something has happened to me, I can't doubt it any more. It came as an illness does, not like an ordinary certainty, not like anything evident. It came cunningly, little by little; I felt a little strange, a little put out, that's all. Once established it never moved, it stayed quiet, and I was able to persuade myself that nothing was the matter with me, that it was a false alarm. And now, it's blossoming.","I exist. It's sweet, so sweet, so slow. And light: you'd think it floated all by itself. It stirs. It brushes by me, melts and vanishes. Gently, gently. There is bubbling water in my throat, it caresses me- and now it comes up again into my mouth. For ever I shall have a little pool of whitish water in my mouth - lying low - grazing my tongue. And this pool is still me. And the tongue. And the throat is me.","I live in the past. I take everything that has happened to me and arrange it. From a distance like that, it doesn't do any harm, you'd almost let yourself be caught in it. Our whole story is fairly beautiful. I give it a few prods and it makes a whole string of perfect moments. Then I close my eyes and try to imagine that I'm still living inside it.","The Nausea is not inside me: I feel it out there in the wall, in the suspenders, everywhere around me. It makes itself one with the café, I am the one who is within it.","I marvel at these young people: drinking their coffee, they tell clear, plausible stories. If they are asked what they did yesterday, they aren't embarrassed: they bring you up to date in a few words.

There can no longer be any good a priori, since there is no infinite and perfect consciousness to think it. It is nowhere written that “the good exists, that one must be honest or must not lie, since we are now upon the plane where there are only men. Dostoevsky once wrote: “If God did not exist, everything would be permitted”; and that, for existentialism, is the starting point. Everything is indeed permitted if God does not exist, and man is in consequence forlorn, for he cannot find anything to depend upon either within or outside himself. He discovers forthwith, that he is without excuse.”","Much more likely you’ll hurt me. Still what does it matter? If I’ve got to suffer, it may as well be at your hands, your pretty hands.","I glance around the room. What a comedy! All these people sitting there, looking serious, eating. No, they aren't eating: they are recuperating in order to successfully finish their tasks. Each one of them has his little personal difficulty which keeps him from noticing that he exists; there isn't one of them who doesn't believe himself indispensable to something or someone. Didn't the Self-Taught Man tell me the other day: \"No one better qualified than Noucapie to undertake this vast synthesis?\" Each one of them does one small thing and no one is better qualified than he to do it. No one is better qualified than the commercial traveler over there to sell Swan Toothpaste. No one better qualified than that interesting young man to put his hand under his girl friend's skirts. And I am among them and if they look at me they must think that no one is better qualified than I to do what I'm doing. But I know. I don't look like much, but I know I exist and that they exist. And if I knew how to convince people I'd go and sit down next to that handsome white-haired gentleman and explain to him just what existence means. I burst out laughing at the thought of the face he would make. The Self-Taught Man looks at me with surprise.

I ran along the docks, turned into the deserted streets in the Beauvoisis district; the houses watched my flight with their mournful eyes. I repeated with anguish: Where shall I go? where shall I go? Anything can happen. Sometimes, my heart pounding, I made a sudden right about turn: what was happening behind my back? Maybe it would start behind me and when I would turn around, suddenly, it would be too late. As long as I could stare at things nothing would happen: I looked at them as much as I could, pavements, houses, gaslights; my eyes went rapidly from one to the other, to catch them unawares, stop them in the midst of their metamorphosis. They didn't look too natural, but I told myself forcibly: this is a gaslight, this is a drinking fountain, and I tried to reduce them to their everyday aspect by the power of my gaze. Several times I came across barriers in my path: the Cafe des Bretons, the Bar de la Marine. I stopped, hesitated in front of their pink net curtains: perhaps these snug places had been spared, perhaps they still held a bit of yesterday's world, isolated, forgotten. But I would have to push the door open and enter. I didn't dare; I went on. Doors of houses frightened me especially. I was afraid they would open of themselves. I ended by walking in the middle of the street.I suddenly came out on the Quai des Bassins du Nord. Fishing smacks and small yachts. I put my foot on a ring set in the stone. Here, far from houses, far from doors, I would have a moment of respite. A cork was floating on the calm, black speckled water.\"And under the water? You haven't thought what could be under the water.\"A monster? A giant carapace? sunk in the mud? A dozen pairs of claws or fins labouring slowly in the slime. The monster rises. At the bottom of the water. I went nearer, watching every eddy and undulation. The cork stayed immobile among the black spots.","Je crois que c'est moi qui ai changé: c'est la solution la plus simple. La plus désagréable aussi.

Pas besoin de gril, l'enfer c'est les autres.","It's your weakness gives them their strength. Mark how they dare not speak to me. A nameless horror has descended on you, keeping us apart. And yet why should this be? What have you lived through that I have not shared? Do you imagine that my mother's cries will ever cease ringing in my ears? Or that my eyes will ever cease to see her great sad eyes, lakes of lambent darkness in the pallor of it will ever cease ravaging my heart? But what matter? I am free. Beyond anguish, beyond remorse. Free. And at one with myself. No, you must not loathe yourself, Electra. Give me your hand. I shall never forsake you.","Then time started flowing again and the emptiness grew larger.","Три часът.

Things have happened to me, events, incidents, anything you like. But not adventures. It isn’t a matter of words; I am beginning to understand. There is something I longed for more than all the rest - without realizing it properly. It wasn’t love, heaven forbid, nor glory, nor wealth. It was…anyway, I had imagined that at certain moments my life could take on a rare and precious quality. There was no need for extraordinary circumstances: all I asked for was a little order. There is nothing very splendid about my life at present: but now and then, for example when they played music in the cafés, I would l look back and say to myself: in the old days, in London, Meknés, Tokyo, I have known wonderful moments, I have had adventures. It is that which has been taken away from me now. I have just learnt, all of a sudden, for no apparent reason, that I have been lying to myself for ten years. Adventures are in books. And naturally, everything they tell you about in books can happen in real life, but not in the same way. It was to this way of happening that I attached so much importance.","I must be without remorse or regrets as I am without excuse; for from the instant of my upsurge into being, I carry the weight of the world by myself alone without anything or any person being able to lighten it.","Commitment is an act, not a word","من وجود مملکتی را که منکر من است انکار خواهم کرد(گوشه نشینان آلتونا)","At an age when most children are playing hopscotch or with their dolls,you, poor child, who had no friends or toys, you toyed with dreams of murder, because that is a game to play alone.","Karsky: I met your father last week.

Otherwise we shall immediately meet with this paradox: the past is no longer, the future is not yet, as for the instantaneous present, everyone knows that it is not at all: it is the limit of infinite division, like the dimensionless point.","From the very fact, indeed, that I am conscious of the motives which solicit my action, these motives are already transcendent objects from my consciousness, they are outside; in vain shall I seek to cling to them: I escape from them through my very existence. I am condemned to exist forever beyond my essence, beyond the affective and rational motives of my act: I am condemned to be free.","The Nausea has stayed down there, in the yellow light. I am happy: this cold is so pure, this night so pure: am I myself not a wave of icy air? With neither blood, nor lymph, nor flesh. Flowing down this long canal towards the pallor down there. To be nothing but coldness.","I had spent my time counterfeiting eternity, I had understood nothing.","Existentialism is no mournful delectation but a humanist philosophy of action, effort, combat, and solidarity. Man must create his own essence: it is in throwing himself into the world, suffering there, struggling there, that he gradually defines say what this man is before he dies, or what mankind is before it has disappeared.","Freedom is what we do with what is done to us","Reflection poisons desire.","It is the good children, Madame, who make the most terrible revolutionaries.

As for men, it's not what they are that interests me, but what they can become.Höderer: And I, I love them for what they are. With all their filth and and all their vices. I love their voices and their warm grasping hands, and their skin, the nudest skin of all, and their uneasy glances, and the desperate struggle each has to pursue against anguish and against death. For me, one man more or less in the world is something that counts. It's something precious. You, I know you now, you are a destroyer. You detest men because you detest yourself.

How come he can't see his own savagery as a colonist in the savagery of these oppressed peasants who have absorbed it through every pore and for which they can find no cure? The answer is simple: this arrogant individual, whose power of authority and fear of losing it has gone to his head, has difficulty remembering he was once a man; he thinks he is a whip or a gun; he is convinced that the domestication of the \"inferior races\" is obtained by governing their reflexes. He disregards the human memory, the indelible reminders; and then, above all, there is this that perhaps he never know: we only become what we are by radically negating deep down what others have done to us.","Je pense, lui dis-je, que nous voilà, tous tant que nous sommes, à manger et à boire pour conserver notre précieuse existence et qu’il n’y a rien, rien, aucune raison d’exister… L’autodidacte répondit que la vie a un sens si on veut bien lui en donner un.

Even if I took a train, a boat, or a motor-bus, if I went to Morocco for my holiday, if I suddenly arrived at Marrakech, I should be always in my room, at home. And if I walked in the squares and in the sooks, if I gripped an Arab's shoulder, to feel Marrakech in his person - well, that Arab would be at Marrakech, not I : I should still be seated in my room, placid and meditative as is my chosen life, two thousand miles away from the Moroccan and his burnoose.

The eyes especially are horrible seen so close. They are glassy, soft, blind, red-rimmed, they look like fish scales... A silky white down covers the great slopes of the cheeks, two hairs protrude from the nostrils: it is a geological embossed map. And, in spite of everything, this lunar world is familiar to me. I cannot say I recognize the details.

Alone and without a future in a stagnant moment, a child is asking murder for strong sensations. Since I'm refused a man's destiny, I'll be the destiny of a fly.

To exist is simply to be there; those who exist let themselves be encountered, but you can never deduce anything from them. I believe there are people who have understood this. Only they tried to overcome this contingency by inventing a necessary, causal being.

Only you must be nice to me too.","جبرنا على ان نكون احرارا و نحن نصنع اختياراتنا بين الالم و الهجر و اليأس سارتر","Perhaps it is impossible to understand one's own face.

I don't know where I am any more: do i see her motions, or do I foresee them? I can no longer distinguish present from future and yet it lasts, it happens little by little; the old woman advances in the deserted street, shuffling her heavy, mannish brogues. This is time, time laid bare, coming slowly into existence, keeping us waiting, and when it does come making us sick because we realise it's been there for a long time. The old woman reaches the corner of the street, no more than a bundle of black clothes. All right then, it's new, she wasn't there a little while ago.

I suddenly lost the appearance of a man and they saw a crab running backwards out of this human room.

The eyes, nose, and mouth disappear. Nothing is left. Brown wrinkles show on each side of the feverish swelled lips, crevices, mole holes. A silky, white down covers the great slopes of the cheeks, two hairs protrude from the nostrils: it is a geological embossed map. And, in spite of everything, this lunar world is familiar to me. I cannot say I recognize the details. But the whole thing gives me an impression of something seen before which stupefies me: I slip quietly off to sleep.","I was there, standing in front of a window whose panes had a definite refraction index.

I remain dry and empty.","And I— soft, weak, obscene, digesting, juggling with dismal thoughts— I, too, was In the way. Fortunately, I didn’t feel it, although I realized it, but I was uncomfortable because I was afraid of feeling it (even now I am afraid— afraid that it might catch me behind my head and lift me up like a wave). I dreamed vaguely of killing myself to wipe out at least one of these superfluous lives. But even my death would have been In the way.In the way, my corpse, my blood on these stones, between these plants, at the back of this smiling garden. And the decomposed flesh would have been In the way in the earth which would receive my bones, at last, cleaned, stripped, peeled, proper and clean as teeth, it would have been In the way: I was In the way for eternity.","But faced with this great wrinkled paw, neither ignorance nor knowledge was important: the world of explanations and reasons is not the world of existence.","There exist concretely alarm clocks, signboards, tax forms, policemen, so many guard rails against anguish. But as soon as the enterprise is held at a distance from me, as soon as I am referred to myself because I must await myself in the future, then I discover myself suddenly as the one who gives its meaning to the alarm clock, the one who by a signboard forbids himself to walk on a flower bed or on the lawn, the one from whom the boss's order borrows its urgency, the one who decides the interest of the book which he is writing, the one who finally makes the values exist in order to determine his action by their demands. I emerge alone and in anguish confronting the unique and original project which constitutes my being; all the barriers, all the guard rails collapse, nihilated by the consciousness of my freedom.","I'm not obstinate, I'm highly strung: I don't know how to let myself go. I must always think of what is happening to me - it's a form of self-protection.","These young people amaze me; drinking their coffee, they tell clear, plausible stories. If you ask them what they did yesterday, they don't get flustered; they tell you all about it in a few words. If I were in their place, I'd start stammering. It's true that for a long time now nobody has bothered how I spend my time. When you live alone, you even forget what it is to tell a story : plausibility disappears at the same time as friends.","Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness and dies by chance.

Will you understand me, for a start, if I tell you that I have never known what I am? My vices, my virtues, are under my nose, but I can’t see them, nor stand far enough back to view myself as a whole. I seem to be a sort of flabby mass in which words are engulfed; no sooner do I name myself than what is named is merged in him who names, and one gets no farther. I have often wanted to hate myself and, as you know, had good reasons for so doing. But my attempted hatred of myself was absorbed into my insubstantiality and was nothing but a recollection. I could not love myself either, I am sure, though I have never tried to. But I was eternally compelled to be myself; I was my own burden, but never burdensome enough, Mathieu. For one instant, on that June evening when I elected to confess to you, I thought I had encountered myself in your bewildered eyes.You saw me, in your eyes I was solid and predictable; my acts and moods were the actual consequences of a definite entity. And through me you knew that entity. I described it to you in my words, I revealed to you facts unknown to you, which had helped you to visualize it. And yet you saw it, I merely saw you seeing it. For one instant you were the heaven-sent mediator between me and myself, you perceived that compact and solid entity which I was and wanted to be in just as simple and ordinary a way as I perceived you. For, after all, I exist, I am, though I have no sense of being; and it is an exquisite torment to discover in oneself such utterly unfounded certainty, such unsubstantiated pride. I then understood that one could not reach oneself except through another’s judgment, another’s hatred. And also through another’s love perhaps; but there is here no question of that. For this revelation I am not ungrateful to you. I do not know how you would describe our present relations. Not goodwill, nor wholly hatred. Put it that there is a corpse between us. My corpse.","Something has happened to me, I can't doubt it anymore. It came as an illness does, not like an ordinary certainty, not like anything evident. It came cunningly, little by little; I felt a little strange, a little put out, that's all. Once established it never moved, it stayed quiet, and i was able to persuade myself that nothing was the matter with me, that it was a false alarm. And now, it's blossoming.","Everything happens to every man as if the entire human race were staring at him and measuring itself by what he does. So every man ought to be asking himself, \"Am I really a man who is entitled to act in such a way that the entire human race should be measuring itself by my actions?\" And if he does not ask himself that, he masks his anguish.","It looked like a colour, but also... like a bruise or a secretion, like an oozing-and something else, an odour, for example, it melted into the odour of wet earth, warm, moist wood, into a black odour that spread like varnish over this sensitive wood, in a flavour of chewed, sweet fibre. I did not simply see this black: sight is an abstract invention, a simplified idea, one of man's ideas. That black, amorphous, weakly presence, far surpassed sight, smell and taste. But this richness was lost in confusion and finally was no more because it was too much.","I get up. I move through this pale light; I see it change beneath my hands and on the sleeves of my coat: I cannot describe how much it disgusts me.","Never were we freer than under the German Occupation.","This is what fools people: a man is always a teller of tales, he lives surrounded by his stories and the stories of others, he sees everything that happens to him through them; and he tries to live his own life as if he were telling a story.

Il y avait des joies simples, triviales : courir, sauter, manger des gâteaux, embrasser la peau douce et parfumée de ma mère; mais j'attachais plus de prix aux plaisirs studieux et mêlés que j'éprouvais dans la compagnie des hommes mûrs : la répulsion qu'ils m'inspiraient faisait partie de leur prestige ; je confondais le dégoût avec l'esprit de sérieux. J'étais snob.","Can you justify your existence then?","You don't put your past in your pocket; you have to have a house. I have only my body: a man entirely alone, with his lonely body, cannot indulge in memories; they pass through him. I shouldn't complain: all I wanted was to be free.","So I was a poodle of the future; I made prophecies.","I slip Anny's letter back into my despatch case: she has done what she could; I cannot reach the woman who took it in her hands, folded and put it in the envelope. Is it possible even to think of someone in the past? As long as we loved each other, we never allowed the meanest of our instants, the smallest grief, to be detached and forgotten, left behind. Sounds, smells, nuances of light, even the thoughts we never told each other; we carried them all away and they remained alive: even now they have the power to give us joy and pain. Not a memory: an implacable, torrid love, without shadow, without escape, without shelter. Three years rolled into one. That is why we parted: we did not have enough strength to bear this burden. And then, when Anny left me, all of a sudden, all at once, the three years crumbled into the past. I didn't even surfer, I felt emptied out. Then time began to flow again and the emptiness grew larger. Then, in Saigon when I decided to go back to France, all that was still left—strange faces, places, quays on the banks of long rivers—all was wiped out. Now my past is nothing more than an enormous vacuum. My present: this waitress in the black blouse dreaming near the counter, this man. It seems as though I have learned all I know of life in books.","Every belief is a belief that falls short; one never wholly believes what one believes.","L'existentialiste, au contraire, pense qu'il est très gênant que Dieu n'existe pas, car avec lui disparaît toute possibilité de trouver des valeurs dans un ciel intelligible; il ne peut plus y avoir de bien a priori, puisqu'il n'y a pas de conscience infinie et parfaite pour le penser; il n'est écrit nulle part que le bien existe, qu'il faut être honnête, qu'il ne faut pas mentir, puisque précisément nous sommes sur un plan où il y a seulement des hommes.","Moi, je ne tiens pas les rancunes et j'avoue tout, complaisamment : pour l'autocritique, je suis doué, à la condition qu'on ne prétende pas me l'imposer.","Existentialism's first move is to make every man aware of what he is and to make the full responsibility of his existence rest on him.","Not only is man what he conceives himself to be, but he is also only what he wills himself to be after this thrust toward existence.

While she was there, I had once asked permission to read Madame Bovary and my mother, in an oversweet voice, had said: 'But if my darling reads books like that at his age, what will he do when he grows up?' 'I shall live them!' This reply had met with the most complete and lasting success.","(...) sólo el perro o el caballo podrían emitir un juicio de conjunto sobre el hombre y declarar que el hombre es asombroso, lo que ellos no se preocupan de hacer, por lo menos que yo sepa.

Es lo que ha dado a mi vida este aspecto desconcertante, incoherente.","There are two ways to go to the gas chamber, free and not free.","THE HOLE The hole is something which longs to be filled. The small child is drawn as if by magic to holes. He can not restrain himself from putting in his finger or his whole arm. He makes a symbolic sacrifice of his body to cause the void to disappear and a plenitude of being to exist. The fundamental tendency of human beings to stop up holes persists throughout life, symbolically and in reality. And only from this standpoint can we understand why the feminine sex is obscene. It is obscene because it is a hole and because it sends out an appeal for a plenitude of flesh. A woman also senses her condition as such an appeal, such an enticement. Thus every hole becomes something obscene because it “is an obscene expectation.","There’s the story of a person who does this, does that, but it isn’t I, I have nothing in common with him. He travels through countries I know no more about than if I had never been there. Sometimes, in my story, it happens that I pronounce these fine names you read in atlases, Aranjuez or Canterbury. New images are born in me, images such as people create from books who have never travelled. My words are dreams, that is all.","A few seconds more and the Negress will sing. It seems inevitable, so strong is the necessity of this music: nothing can interrupt it, nothing which comes from this time in which the world has fallen; it will stop by itself, as if by order. If I love this beautiful voice it is especially because of that: it is neither for its fulness nor its sadness, rather because it is the event for which so many notes have been preparing, from so far away, dying that it might be born. And yet I am troubled; it would take so little to make the record stop: a broken spring, the whim of Cousin Adolphe. How strange it is, how moving, that this hardness should be so fragile. Nothing can interrupt it yet it can break it. The last chord has died away. In the brief silence which follows I feel strongly that there is, that SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED.Silence.\"SOME OF THESE DAYSYOU'LL MISS ME HONEY","آدمی همان طور که دچار امراض میشود دچار عقاید هم میشود","My existence began to worry me seriously.

I was the particle at the beginning of its trajectory and the series of waves which flows back on it after it has struck the terminal buffer. Reassembled and compressed, one hand on my tomb and the other on my cradle, I felt brief and splendid, a flash of lightening swallowed up in darkness.","I felt that the success of the enterprise was in my hands: the moment had an obscure meaning which had to be trimmed and perfected ; certain motions had to be made, certain words spoken : I staggered under the weight of my responsibility. I started and saw nothing, I struggled in the midst of rites which were invented on the spot and tore them to shreds with my strong arms. At those times she hated me.","Her eyes stare at me but she seems not to see me; she looks as though she were lost in her suffering.","I feel my hand.

It's long, long, this impression of weight, it doesn't pass. There is no reason for it to pass. It becomes intolerable ... I draw back my hand and put it in my pocket; but immediately I feel the warmth of my thigh through the stuff. I pull my hand out of my pocket and let it hang against the back of the chair. Now I feel a weight at the end of my arm. It pulls a little, softly, insinuatingly it exists. I don't insist: no matter where I put it it will go on existing; I can't suppress it, nor can I suppress the rest of my body, the sweaty warmth, which soils my shirt, nor all this warm obesity which turns lazily, as if someone were stirring it with a spoon, nor all the sensations going on inside, going, coming, mounting from my side to my armpit or quietly vegetating from morning to night, in their usual corner.","Algo comienza para terminar; la aventura no admite añadiduras; sólo cobra sentido con su muerte.

But behind the existence which falls from one present to the other, without a past, without a future, behind these sounds which decompose from day to day, peel off and slip towards death, the melody stays the same, young and firm, like a pitiless witness.","The word “subjectivism is to be understood in two senses, and our adversaries play upon only one of them. Subjectivism means, on the one hand, the freedom of the individual subject and, on the other, that man cannot pass beyond human subjectivity. It is the latter which is the deeper meaning of existentialism. When we say that man chooses himself, we do mean that every one of us must choose himself; but by that we also mean that in choosing for himself he chooses for all men. For in effect, of all the actions a man may take in order to create himself as he wills to be, there is not one which is not creative, at the same time, of an image of man such as he believes he ought to be. To choose between this or that is at the same time to affirm the value of that which is chosen; for we are unable ever to choose the worse. What we choose is always the better; and nothing can be better for us unless it is better for all. If, moreover, existence precedes essence and we will to exist at the same time as we fashion our image, that image is valid for all and for the entire epoch in which we find ourselves.

They have dragged out their life in stupor and semi-sleep, they have married hastily, out of impatience, they have made children at random. They have met other men in cafés, at weddings and funerals.

All that has happened around them has eluded them; long, obscure shapes, events from afar, brushed by them rapidly and when they turned to look all had vanished. And then, around forty, they christen their small obstinacies and a few proverbs with the name of experience, they begin to simulate slot machines: put a coin in the left hand slot and you get tales wrapped in silver paper, put a coin in the slot on the right and you get precious bits of advice that stick to your teeth like caramels.","جهنم دیگری است!","من تقوا ندارم، شاید فرزندان ما باتقوا شوند، به‌شرط آنکه ما آن‌قدر خون جاری کنیم تا حق داشتن فضیلت را به آنها بدهیم.","For the moment they wanted to live with the least expenditure, economize words, gestures, thoughts, float: they had only one day in which to smooth out their wrinkles, their crow’s feet, the bitter lines made by a hard week’s work.

Neither is there any end: you never leave a woman, a friend, a city in one go. And then everything looks alike: Shanghai, Moscow, Algiers, everything is the same after two weeks. There are moments—rarely—when you make a landmark, you realize that you're going with a woman, in some messy business. The time of a flash. After that, the procession starts again, you begin to add up hours and days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. April, May, June. 1924, 1925, 1926.That's living. But everything changes when you tell about life; it's a change no one notices: the proof is that people talk about true stories.

You seem to start at the beginning: \"It was a fine autumn evening...","From time to time I yawn so widely that tears roll down my cheek.","كان يحب أن يريها لوحات جميلة وأفلاماً جميلة، وأشياء جميلة، لأنه لم يكن جميلاً، وكان ذلك بمثابة الاعتذار.","Or a mother might look at her child's cheek and ask him: \"What's that, a pimple?\" and see the flesh puff out a little, split, open, and at the bottom of the split an eye, a laughing eye might appear. Or they might feel things gently brushing against their bodies, like the caresses of reeds to swimmers in a river. And they will realize that their clothing has become living things. And someone else might feel something scratching in his mouth. He goes to the mirror, opens his mouth: and his tongue is an enormous, live centipede, rubbing its legs together and scraping his palate. He'd like to spit it out, but the centipede is a part of him and he will have to tear it out with his own hands. And a crowd of things will appear for which people will have to find new names, stone eye, great three cornered arm, toe crutch, spider jaw.","The vocal chorus will be along shortly: I like that part especially and the abrupt manner in which it throws itself forward, like a cliff against the sea. For the moment, the jazz is playing; there is no melody, only notes, a myriad of tiny jolts. They know no rest, an inflexible order gives birth to them and destroys them without even giving them time to recuperate and exist for themselves. They race, they press forward, they strike me a sharp blow in passing and are obliterated. I would like to hold them back, but I know if I succeeded in stopping one it would remain between my fingers only as a raffish languishing sound. I must accept their death; I must even will it. I know few impressions stronger or more harsh.","Three o'clock. Three o'clock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do. An odd moment in the afternoon.","- Un hombre que está solo es hermoso.- Tan hermoso que enseguida da ganas de hacerle compañía. Y desde entonces deja de estar solo: así es el mundo.","Je n'ai jamais gratté la terre ni quêté des nids, je n'ai pas herborisé ni lancé des pierres aux oiseaux. Mais les livres ont été mes oiseaux et mes nids, mes bêtes domestiques, mon étable et ma campagne.","This is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free: condemned, because he did not create himself, yet nonetheless free, because once cast into the world, he is responsible for everything that he does.","In choosing myself, I choose man.","الحقيقة هي أن التعذيب يخلق الجلادين","J'ai commencé ma vie comme je la finirai sans doute : au milieu des livres. Dans le bureau de mon grand-père, il y en avait partout ; défense était de les faire épousseter sauf une fois l'an, avant la rentrée d'octobre. Je ne savais pas encore lire que, déjà, je les révérais, ces pierres levées : droites ou penchées, serrées comme des briques sur les rayons de la bibliothèque ou noblement espacées en allées de menhirs, je sentais que la prospérité de notre famille en dépendait...","Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself. Such is the first principle of existentialism.","Thing are bad! Things are very bad: I have it, the filth, the Nausea.","My thought is me: that's why I can't stop. I exist because I think...and I can't stop myself from thinking. At this very moment, it's frightful, if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing. I am the one who pulls myself from the nothingness to which I aspire: the hatred, the disgust of existing, there are as many ways to make myself exist, to thrust myself into existence. Thoughts are born at the back of me, like sudden giddiness, I feel them being born behind my head...if I yield, they're going to come round in front of me, between my eyes, and I always yield, the thought grows and grows and there it is, immense, filling me completely and renewing my existence.","And all these existents which bustled about this tree came from nowhere and were going nowhere. Suddenly they existed, then suddenly they existed no longer: existence is without memory; of the vanished it retains nothing—not even a memory. Existence everywhere, infinitely, in excess, for ever and everywhere; existence—which is limited only by existence. I sank down on the bench, stupefied, stunned by this profusion of beings without origin: everywhere blossomings, hatchings out, my ears buzzed with existence, my very flesh throbbed and opened, abandoned itself to the universal burgeoning. It was repugnant. But why, I thought, why so many existences, since they all look alike? What good are so many duplicates of trees? So many existences missed, obstinately begun again and again missed—like the awkward efforts of an insect fallen on its back? (I was one of those efforts.)","I shall never sleep again. Butthen—how shall I endure my own company?","La patronne était là, j'ai dû la baiser, mais c'était bien par politesse.","Mais comme mes regards tombaient sur le bloc de feuilles blanches, je fus saisi par son aspect et je restai, la plume en l'air, à contempler ce papier éblouissant : comme il était dur et voyant, comme il était présent. Il n'y avait rien en lui que du présent. Les lettres que je venais d'y tracer n'étaient pas encore sèches et déjà elles ne m'appartenaient plus.","She smiled. First I lost the memory of her eyes, then the memory of her long body. I kept her smile as long as possible and then, finally lost that three years ago. Just now, brusquely, as I was taking the letter from the landlady's hands, it came back to me; I thought I saw Anny smiling. I try to refresh my memory: I need to feel all the tenderness that Anny inspires; it is there, this tenderness, it is near me, only asking to be born. But the smile does not return: it is finished. I remain dry and empty.","My existence was beginning to cause me serious concern. Was I a mere figment of the imagination?","Everything happens to every man as though the whole human race had its eyes fixed upon what he is doing and regulated its conduct accordingly.","It was true, I had always realized it—I hadn’t any “right to exist at all. I had appeared by chance, I existed like a stone, a plant, a microbe. I could feel nothing to myself but an inconsequential buzzing. I was thinking…that here we are eating and drinking, to preserve our precious existence, and that there’s nothing, nothing, absolutely no reason for existing.”","To exist is to create your own life.","The writer, a free man adressing free men, has only one subject - freedom","He is not one: he is afraid. What is he afraid of? When you want to understand something you stand in front of it, alone, without help: all the past in the world is of no use. Then it disappears and what you wanted to understand disappears with it.","[E]very man ought to say to himself, \"Am I really the kind of man who has the right to act in such a way that humanity might guide itself by my actions?","I began my life as I shall no doubt end it: among books. In my grandfather's study, they were everywhere; it was forbidden to dust them except once a year, before the October term. Even before I could read, I already revered these raised stones; upright or leaning, wedged together like bricks on the library shelves or nobly placed like avenues of dolmens, I felt that our family prosperity depended on them. They were all alike, and I was romping about in a tiny sanctuary, surrounded by squat, ancient monuments which had witnessed my birth, which would witness my death and whose permanence guaranteed me a future as calm as my past. I used to touch them in secret to honour my hands with their dust but I did not have much idea what to do with them and each day I was present at ceremonies whose meaning escaped me: my grandfather - so clumy, normally, that my grandmother buttoned his gloves for him - handled these cultural objects with the dexterity of an officiating priest. Hundreds of times I saw him get up absent-mindedly, walk round the table, cross the room in two strides, unhesitatingly pick out a volume without allowing himself time for choice, run through it as he went back to his armchair, with a combined movement of his thumb and right forefinger, and, almost before he sat down, open it with a flick \"at the right page,\" making it creak like a shoe. I sometimes got close enough to observe these boxes which opened like oysters and I discovered the nakedness of their internal organs, pale, dank, slightly blistering pages, covered with small black veins, which drank ink and smelt of mildew.","nothing that exists can be comic; it was like a floating analogy, almost entirely elusive, with certain aspects of vaudeville.","How far away from them I feel, up on this hill. It seems to me that I belong to another species.","There is something I longed for more than all the rest – without realizing it properly. It wasn’t love, heaven forbid, nor glory, nor wealth. It was... anyway, I had imagined that at certain moments my life could take on a rare and precious quality.","GARCIN: This bronze. Yes, now's the moment; I'm looking at this thing on the mantelpiece, and I understand that I'm in hell. I tell you, everything's been thoughtout beforehand. They knew I'd stand at the fireplace stroking this thing of bronze, with all those eyes intent on me. Devouring me. What? Only two of you? I thought there were more; many more. So this is hell. I'd never have believed it. You remember all we were told about the torture-chambers, the fire and brimstone, the \"burning marl.\" Old wives' tales! There's no need for red-hot pokers. HELL IS-OTHER PEOPLE!","Someone will say, \"I did not ask to be born.\" This is a naive way of throwing greater emphasis on our facticity. I am responsible for everything, in fact,except for my very responsibility, for I am not the foundation of my being. Therefore everything takes place as if I were compelled to be responsible. I am abandoned in the world, not in the sense that I might remain abandoned and passive in a hostile universe like a board floating on the water, but rather in the sense that I find myself suddenly alone and without help, engaged in a world for which I bear the whole responsibility without being able, whatever I do, to tear myself away from this responsibility for an instant. For I am responsible for my very desire of fleeing responsibilities. To make myself passive in the world, to refuse to act upon things and upon Others is still to choose myself, and suicide is one mode among others of being-in-the-world. Yet I find an absolute responsibility for the fact that my facticity (here the fact of my birth) is directly inapprehensible and even inconceivable, for this fact of my birth never appears as a brute fact but always across a projective reconstruction of my for-itself. I am ashamed of being born or I am astonished at it or I rejoice over it, or in attempting to get rid of my life I affirm that I live and I assume this life as bad. Thus in a certain sense I choose being born.","Aku suka menyadari betapa kerasnya buku bertahan, tidak pernah mau takluk begitu saja padaku; aku jadi terpedaya, capai, tetapi aku amat menikmati ambiguitas posisiku: \"mengerti tetapi tidak mengerti\".","A doll with skin like that isn't going to mess it up with a revolver shot. [...] Revolvers are meant for crocodile-skins like ours.","L'homme est une passion inutile","« L’homme sensible moderne » ne souffre pas pour tel ou tel motif particulier, mais, en général, parce que rien de cette terre ne saurait contenter ses désirs.","Las palabras se habían desvanecido, y con ellas la significación de las cosas, sus modos de empleo, las débiles marcas que los hombres han trazado en su superficie. Estaba sentado, un poco encorvado, cabizbajo, solo frente a aquella masa negra y nudosa, enteramente bruta y que me daba miedo. Y entonces tuve esa iluminación.","Love was not something to be felt, not a particular emotion, nor yet a particular shade of feeling, it was much more like a lowering curse on the horizon, a precursor of disaster.","Society demands that he limit himself to his function… There are indeed many precautions to imprison a man in what he is as if we lived in perpetual fear that he might escape from it, that he might break away and suddenly elude his condition.","It is an abstract change without object. Am I the one who has changed? (...) I must finally realize that I am subject to these sudden transformations. The thing is that I rarely think; a crowd of small metamorphoses accumulate in me without my noticing it, and then, one fine day, a veritable revolution takes place. This is what has given my life such a jerky, incoherent aspect.","I do not think, therefore I am a moustache.","Dans mes mains, par exemple, il y a quelque chose de neuf, une certaine façon de prendre ma pipe ou ma fourchette. Ou bien c'est la fourchette qui a, maintenant, une certaine façon de se faire prendre, je ne sais pas.","C'est ça le temps, le temps tout nu, ça vient lentement à l'existence, ça se fait attendre et quand ça vient, on est écoeuré parce qu'on s'aperçoit que c'était déjà là depuis longtemps.","تو کیستی که به من امر می‌کنی؟ و شما چه احتیاجی به شنیدن اوامر او دارید؟ هیچ‌کس حق ندارد به شما امر کند مگر روسایی که خودتان انتخاب کرده‌اید.","También ellos necesitan ser muchos para existir","¿Cómo se puede mentir poniendo a la razón de parte de uno?","والكافر يثور على نفسه وعلى سعادته إلى حد أنه يجرد نفسه من الوسيلة التي تجعله يموت متعزياإنه مهووس بالله ، يشاهد غيابه في كل مكانولا يستطيع أن يفتح فاهاً دون أن يلفظ إسمه","Concha would cry when she found out I was dead, she should have no taste for life for months afterward. But I was still the one who was going to die. I thought of her soft, beautiful eyes. when she looked at me something passed her to me. But I knew it was over: if she looked at me now the look would stay in her eyes, it wouldn't reach me. I was alone","Hiçbir şey değişmedi, ama yine de her şey başka bir biçimde var olup gidiyor. Anlatamıyorum. Bulantıya benziyor bu, ama aynı zamanda onun tam tersi.","I do not cease to experience my being-for-others; my possibilities do not cease to “die, nor do the distances cease to unfold toward me in terms of the stairway where somebody “could” be, in terms of this dark corner where a human presence “could” hide. Better yet, if I tremble at the slightest noise, if each creak announces to me a look, this is because I am already in the state of being-looked-at.”","The truth is that I can’t put down my pen: I think I’m going to have the Nausea and I feel as though I’m delaying it while writing. So I write whatever comes into my mind.","Nous sommes seuls, sans excuses. C’est ce que j’exprimerais en disant que l’homme est condamné à être libre. Condamné, parce qu’il ne s’est pas créé lui-même, et par ailleurs cependant libre, parce qu’une fois jeté dans le monde, il est responsable de tout ce qu’il fait. […] L’homme, sans aucun secours, est condamné à chaque instant à inventer l’homme.","كانت تحس نفسها حزينة حزنًا يكفي لاثنين","A man is always a teller of stories (...) and he tries to live his life as if he were recounting it","She believed in nothing; only her skepticism kept her from being an athiest.","Giacometti knows that space is a cancer on being, and eats everything; to sculpt, for him, is to take the fat off space, he compresses space, so as to drain off its exteriority.","Tuesday:Nothing. Existed.","all of us abandon ourselves to existence, because we were amongourselves, only among ourselves, it has taken us unawares, in the disorder, the day to day drift: I amashamed for myself and for what exists in front of it.","The sun was clear and diaphanous like white win. Its light barely touched the moving figures, gave them no shadow, no relief: faces and hands made spots of pale gold.","And then, tired out by all the shouting, I always simply went to bed. Today I’m doing it to feel the pleasure you don’t yet know, of turning abruptly from friendship to love, from strength to tenderness. Tonight I love you in a way that you have not known in me: I am neither worn down by travels nor wrapped up in the desire for your presence. I am mastering my love for you and turning it inwards as a constituent element of myself.","This is the girl, here, this girl with a ruined look who touches me and whom I love.","I felt that the success of the enterprise was in my hands: the moment had an obscure meaning which had to be trimmed and perfected; certain motions had to be made, certain words spoken: I staggered under the weight of my responsibility.","Everything looks so much alike that you wonder how people got the idea of inventing names, to make distinctions.","aramızda ancak bir beğeni ayrımı olsaydı tedirgin etmeyecektim sizi. ama her şey sizin yeteneğiniz varmış da benim yokmuş gibisine akıp gidiyor. amerikanvari hazırlanmış ıstakozu sevip sevmemekte özgürüm, ama insanları sevmiyorsam bir zavallıyım ve günışığında bana yer yok. onlar hayatın anlamını kendi tekellerine aldılar. umarım ki söylemek istediğimi anlıyorsunuz. üstünde: insancıl olmayan buraya giremez yazılı kapıları otuz üç yıldır zorluyorum işte. giriştiğim her şeyi bırakmak zorunda kaldım. seçmek gerekiyordu: ya uyumsuz ve mahkûm edilmiş bir girişimi, ya da er-geç onların çıkarına yönelmesi gereken bir girişimi.","Seuls les actes décident de ce qu'on a voulu.","Couldn't I try...Naturally, it wouldn't be a question of a tune...But couldn't I in another medium?...It would have to be a book: I don't know how to do anything else. But not a history book: history talks about what has existed - an existent can never justify the existence of another existent. My mistake was to try to resuscitate Monsieur de Rollebon. Another kind of book. I don't quite know which kind - but you would have to guess, behind the printed words, behind the pages, something which didn't exist, which was above existence. The sort of story, for example, which could never happen, an adventure. It would have to be beautiful and hard as steel and make people ashamed of their existence.I am going, I feel irresolute. I dare not make a decision. If I were sure that I had talent...but I have never, never written anything of that sort; historical articles, yes - if you could call them that. A book. A novel. And there would be people who would read this novel and who would say: 'It was Antoine Roquentin who wrote it, he was a red-headed fellow who hung about in cafés', and they would think that about my life as I think about the life of the Negress: as about something precious and almost legendary. A book. Naturally, at first it would only be a tedious, tiring job, it wouldn't prevent me from existing or from feeling that I exist. But a time would have to come when the book would be written, would be behind me, and I think that a little of its light would fall over my past. Then, through it, I might be able to recall my life without repugnance. Perhaps one day, thinking about this very moment, about this dismal moment at which I am waiting, round-shouldered, for it to be time to get on the train, perhaps I might feel my heart beat faster and say to myself: 'It was on that day, at that moment that it all started.' And I might succeed - in the past, simply in the past - in accepting myself.","One always dies too soon -- or too late. And yet one's whole life is complete at that moment, with a line drawn neatly under it, ready for the summing up.","There are also amateurs. These are secretaries, office workers, shopkeepers, people who listen to others in cafes: around forty they feel swollen, with an experience they can't get rid of. Luckily they've made children on whom they can pass it off. They would like to make us believe that theirpast is not lost, that their memories are condensed, gently transformed into Wisdom.","M. de Rollebon was my partner; he needed me in order to exist and I needed him so as not to feel my existence.","Quizá no haya nada en el mundo que me interese tanto como este sentimiento de aventura. Pero viene cuando quiere; y se va tan rápido, que me deja agotado. ¿Me hará estas breves visitas irónicas para demostrarme que he frustado mi vida?","El pasado es un lujo de propietario. ¿Dónde podría conservar yo el mío? Nadie se mete el pasado en el bolsillo; hay que tener una casa para acomodarlo. Mi cuerpo es lo único que poseo; un hombre solo, con su cuerpo, no puede detener los recuerdos; pasan a través de él. No debería quejarme: sólo he querido ser libre.","Farewell, beautiful lilies, elegant in your painted little sanctuaries, good-bye, lovely lilies, our pride and reason for existing, good-bye you bastards!","Undoubtedly, on his death bed, at that moment when, ever since Socrates, it has been proper to pronounce certain elevated words, he told his wife, as one of my uncles told his, whohad watched beside him for twelve nights, \"I do not thank you, Therese; you have only done your duty.","If [literature] should turn into pure propaganda or pure entertainment, society will slip back into the sty of the immediate -- which is to say, the memoryless existence of hymenoptera and gastropods.

If you go too far you come up against the vegetation belt. Vegetation has crawled for miles towards the cities. It is waiting. Once the city is dead, the vegetation will cover it, will climb over the stones, grip them, search them, make them burst with its long black pincers; it will blind the holes and let its green paws hang over everything. You must stay in the cities as long as they are alive, you must never penetrate alone this great mass of hair waiting at the gates; you must let it undulate and crack all by itself.","We speak more freely of our emotional complexes than of our material condition or of our socio-professional milieu; we prefer to ask ourselves about the homosexual component of our characters than about the history which has made us and which we have made. We too are victims and accomplices of alienation, reification, mystification. We too stagger beneath 'the weight of things said and done', of lies accepted and transmitted without belief. But we have no wish to know it.

Ya está. La cosa gris acaba de aparecer en el espejo. Me acerco y la miro; ya no puedo irme. Es el reflejo de mi rostro. A menudo en estos días perdidos, me quedo contemplándolo. No comprendo nada en este rostro. Los de los otros tienen un sentido. El mío, no. Ni siquiera puedo decidir si es lindo o feo. Pienso que es feo, porque me lo han dicho. Pero no me sorprende. En el fondo, a mí mismo me choca que puedan atribuirle cualidades de ese tipo, como si llamaran lindo o feo a un montón de tierra o a un bloque de piedra.","Gömleğinin üzerindeki o iki tanımlanamaz leke, gözümün önünde yeniden belirdi. Ya çakıl taşı, bütün bu hikayenin başlangıcı olan şu ünlü çakıl taşı yok mu, o da...ne olmak istemediğini şimdi pek iyi hatırlamıyordum. Ama onun edilgen direncini unutmamıştım. Ya Otodidakt'ın eli? Bir gün kitaplıkta bu eli sıkmış ve bunun bir ele benzemediğini duymuştum. Kocaman beyaz bir kurt gelmişti aklıma, ama tam bu da değildi. Hele Mably Kahvesi'ndeki bira bardağının ne idüğü belirsiz saydamlığı. Ne idüğü belirsiz! İşte seslerin, kokuların, tatların özelliği. Yuvalarından uğratılmış tavşanlar gibi, önünüzden hızla geçtikleri ve onlara fazla dikkat etmediğiniz zaman, güven verici ve düpedüz varlıklar olduklarına inanabilirdiniz...Yeryüzünde, gerçek mavi, gerçek kırmızı, bir gerçek kayısı ya da menekşe kokusu olduğuna inanabilirdiniz. Ama onları bir an durdurduğunuzda, bu güven ve rahatlık duygusu yerini derin bir tedirginliğe bırakıyordu: Renkler, tatlar ve kokular hiçbir zaman gerçek değildi, hiçbir zaman kendileri ve sadece kendileri olarak kalmıyorlardı. En yalın niteliğin bile, kendinde, kendisi bakımından ta içinde ta içinde bir fazlalık vardı. Şurada, ayağımın altında duran şu siyah, siyahtan çok, bu rengi hiç görmemiş, ama hayal gücünü durdurmasını beceremeyen bir kimsenin, siyahı hayal etmek için harcadığı çabayı hatırlatıyordu.Bu çabayla o kimse, renklerin ötesinde ne idüğü belirsiz bir varlık düşünmüştü.Bu, bir renge benziyordu, ama aynı zamanda...bir çürüğe,bir salgıya,bir sızıntıya da benziyordu. Başka bir şeye, sözgelimi bir kokuya da benziyordu. Çünkü bu, ıslak toprak, yaş ve ısınmış odun kokusu, şu sinirli ağaç parçası üzerine cila gibi yayılmış siyah koku, çiğnenmiş şekerli lif tadı içinde eriyordu. Bu siyah rengi tek başına görmüyordum, görme gücü soyut bir icat; temizlenmiş, yalınlaştırılmış bir düşünce; insanların bir düşüncesidir. Şuradaki siyah, biçimden yoksun ve tüylü şu bulunuş; görme, koklama ve tatma güçlerini aşıp geçiyor, onlardan taşıyordu.

Nor, on the other hand, if God does not exist, are we provided with any values or commands that could legitimise our behaviour. Thus we have neither behind us, nor before us in a luminous realm of values, any means of justification or excuse. – We are left alone, without excuse. That is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for everything he does.","Like all dreamers I confuse disenchantment with truth","People are like dice, you throw yourself in the direction of your own choosing....","Hell is other people","Nothing can interrupt it yet all can break it.","He raised himself on his hands and looked at Irene's face: the nudity of that feminine body had risen into her face, the body had reabsorbed it, as nature reabsorbs forsaken gardens.","Thus pleasure itself, also becoming a right, lost its aggressive futility.","The flesh is the pure contingency of presence.","La mayor parte del tiempo, al no unirse a palabras, mis pensamientos quedan en la niebla.

Yes, but, to tell the whole truth, it made a profound impression on me: it occurred to me that I was no longer free.","But I can't see anything any more: however much I search the past I can only retrieve scraps of images and I am not sure what they represent, nor whether they are remembered or invented.","Existentialism is not atheist in the sense that it would exhaust itself in demonstrations of the non-existence of God. It declares, rather, that even if God existed that would make no difference from its point of view. Not that we believe God does exist, but we think that the real problem is not that of His existence; what man needs is to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the existence of God.","If existence really does precede essence, there is no explaining things away by reference to a fixed and given human nature, In other words, there is no determinism, man is free, man is freedom. On the other hand, if God does not exist, we find no values or commands to turn to which legitimize our conduct. So, in the bright realm of values, we have no excuses behind us, no justification before us. We are alone with no excuses.This is the idea I shall try to convey when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet in other respects is free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.","First, it has been charged with inviting people to remain in a kind of desperate quietism because, since no solutions are possible, we should have to consider action in this world as quite impossible. We should then end up in a philosophy of contemplation; and since contemplation is a luxury, we come in the end to a bourgeois philosophy. The communists in particular have made these charges.","I exist because I think … and I can't stop myself from thinking. At this very moment–it's frightful–if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing.","Algo comienza para terminar: la aventura no admite añadidos; sólo cobra sentido con su muerte.","Chitchat debases a language.","می‌خواهید به شما بگویم چرا از مرگ نمی‌ترسید؟ چون هرکدام از شما فکر می‌کند مرگ به سر دیگری نازل خواهد شد نه به سر خودش. در این جنگ همه کشته خواهند شد.","A work of art is only a page torn from a life. It expresses this life, of course, but it could have very well not expressed it. No matter, for everything has the same value, whether it be writing The Possessed or drinking a cup of coffee.","It is no good putting yourself in the dead man's shoes, pretending to share his passions, his blunders, and his prejudices, reawakening vanished moments of strength, impatience, or apprehension; you cannot help assessing his behaviour in light of results which he could not foresee and of information which he did not possess, or attributing a particular solemnity to events whose effects marked him later, but which he lived through casually. That is the mirage: the future is more real than the present. It is not surprising: in a completed life, the end is taken as the truth of the beginning. The dead man stands half-way between being and worth, between the crude fact and its reconstruction: his history becomes a kind of circular essence which is summed up in each of his moments.","But an adventure never returns nor is prolonged.","Мягкий свет; люди сидят по домам, они, конечно, тоже зажгли лампы. Они читают или смотрят в окно на небо. Для них... для них все иначе. Они состарились по-другому. Они живут среди завещанного добра, среди подарков, и каждый предмет их обстановки - воспоминание. Каминные часы, медали, портреты, ракушки, пресс-папье, ширмы, шали. Их шкафы битком набиты бутылками, отрезами, старой одеждой, газетами - они сохранили все. Прошлое это роскошь собственника.А где бы я стал хранить свое прошлое? Прошлое в карман не положишь, надо иметь дом, где его разместить. У меня есть только мое тело, одинокий человек со своим одиноким телом не может удержать воспоминания, они проходят сквозь него. Я не имею права жаловаться: я хотел одного - быть свободным.","The function of a writer is to call a spade a spade. If words are sick, it is up to us to cure them. Instead of that, many writers live off this sickness. In many cases modern literature is a cancer of words. ... There is nothing more deplorable than the literary practice which, I believe, is called poetic prose and which consists of using words for the obscure harmonics which reosund about them and which are made up of vague meanings which are in contradiction with the clear meaning. .... That is not all: we are living in an age of mystifications. Some are fundamental ones which are due to the structure of society; some are secondary. At any rate, the social order today rests upon the mystification of consciousness, as does disorder as well.","Those who conceal from themselves this total freedom, under the guise of solemnity, or by making deterministic excuses, I will call cowards. Others, who try to prove their existence is necessary, when man's appearance on earth is merely contingent, I will call bastards.","what summits would I not reach if my own life made the subject of the melody.","C'est tout pareil quand on a perdu l'illusion d'être eternel.","That is the idea I shall try to convey when I say that man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet, in other respects is free; because, once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does. The existentialist does not believe in the power of passion. He will never agree that a sweeping passion is a ravaging torrent which fatally leads a man to certain acts and is therefore an excuse. He thinks that man is responsible for his passion.","La plupart du temps, faute de s'attacher à des mots, mes pensées restent des brouillards. Elles dessinent des formes vagues et plaisantes, s'engloutissent : aussitôt, je les oublie.","hidup yang tak teruji tak layak dijalani","But a little while ago I made an experiment with the absolute or the absurd. This root—there was nothing in relation to which it was absurd. Oh, how can I put it in words? Absurd: in relation to the stones, the tufts of yellow grass, the dry mud, the tree, the sky, the green benches. Absurd, irreducible; nothing—not even a profound, secret upheaval of nature—couldexplain it. Evidently I did not know everything, I had not seen the seeds sprout, or the tree grow. Butfaced with this great wrinkled paw, neither ignorance nor knowledge was important: the world of explanations and reasons is not the world of existence.","In irony a man annihilates what he posits within one and the same act; he leads us to believe in order not to be believed; he affirms to deny and denies to affirm; he creatives a positive object but it has no being other than its nothingness.","Le secret douloureux des Dieux et des rois: c'est que les hommes sont libres. Ils sont libres Egisthe.

Existence everywhere, infinitely, in excess, for ever and everywhere; existence—which is limited only by existence.","What he [the intellectual] should learn to do is to put what he has been able to salvage from the disciplines that taught him universal techniques, directly at the service of the masses. Intellectuals must learn to understand the universal that the masses want, in reality, in the immediate, at this very moment.","Camın öte tarafından bana baktıklarını görmek için dönmem gerekli değil. Şaşkınlık ve tiksintiyle sırtımı gözlerler şimdi; kendileri gibi bir kimse, bir insan olduğumu düşünüyorlardı, ama onları aldattım ben.

I dive under the table and push the chest against his patent leather shoes, I put an armload of post cards and photos on his lap: Spain and Spanish Morocco.But I see by his laughing, open look that I have been singularly mistaken in hoping to reduce him to silence. He glances over a view of San Sebastian from Monte Igueldo, sets it cautiously on the table and remains silent for an instant. Then he sighs:'Ah, Monsieur, you're lucky ... if what they say is true-travel is the best school. Is that your opinion, Monsieur?'I make a vague gesture. Luckily he has not finished.'It must be such an upheaval. If I were ever to go on a trip, I think I should make written notes of the slightest traits of my character before leaving, so that when I returned I would be able to compare what I was and what I had become.

Al llegar a la verja, me volví. Entonces el jardín me sonrió. Me apoyé en la verja y miré largo rato. La sonrisa de los árboles, de macizo de laurel quería decir algo; aquél era el verdadero secreto de la existencia.","Мне стыдно за мсье Ахилла. Мы с ним два сапога пара, мы должны быть заодно против них. А он меня предал и перешел на их сторону: он искренне верит – верит в Опыт. Не в свой, не в мой. А в опыт доктора Роже.Как бы я хотел сказать ему, что его обманывают, что он подыгрывает спесивцам. Это они-то профессионалы опыта? Да они всю жизнь прозябали в отупелом полусне, от нетерпения женились с бухты-барахты, наудачу мастерили детей. В кафе, на свадьбах, на похоронах встречались с другими людьми. Время от времени, попав в какой-нибудь водоворот, барахтались и отбивались, не понимая, что с ними происходит. Все, что совершалось вокруг, начиналось и кончалось вне поля их зрения: смутные продолговатые формы, события, нагрянувшие издали, мимоходом задели их, а когда они хотели разглядеть, что же это такое, – все уже было кончено. И вот к сорока годам они нарекают опытом свои мелкие пристрастия и небольшой набор пословиц и начинают действовать, как торговые автоматы: сунешь монетку в левую щелку – вот тебе два-три примера из жизни в упаковке из серебряной фольги, сунешь монетку в правую щелку – получай ценные советы, вязнущие в зубах, как ириски. Только все дело в том, что эти разговоры набили мне оскомину еще в юности. Правда, вырос я не в семье профессионалов. Но существуют ведь и любители. Секретари, служащие, торговцы, те, кто в кафе слушают других; к сорока годам их распирает опыт, который они не могут сбыть на сторону. По счастью, они наплодили детей, их-то они и заставляют потреблять этот опыт, не сходя с места. Они хотели бы внушить нам, что их прошлое не пропало даром, что их воспоминания потихоньку сгустились, обратившись в Мудрость. Удобное прошлое! Карманное прошлое, книжица из золотой библиотеки, полная прописных истин. «Поверьте мне, я говорю на основании опыта, всему, что я знаю, меня научила жизнь». Да разве Жизнь взялась бы думать за них? Все новое они объясняют с помощью старого, а старое – с помощью событий еще более древних...Питаться общими соображениями куда отраднее. К тому же профессионалы, да и любители тоже, в конце концов всегда оказываются правы. Их мудрость советует производить как можно меньше шума, как можно меньше жить, постараться, чтобы о тебе забыли. Больше всего они любят рассказывать о людях неблагоразумных, о чудаках, которых постигла кара. Ну что ж, наверно, так и бывает, никто не станет утверждать обратное. Быть может, у мсье Ахилла совесть не совсем спокойна. Быть может, он думает – послушайся он советов своего отца, своей старшей сестры, он не дошел бы до того, до чего дошел. Доктор вправе судить. Он ведь не загубил свою жизнь, он сумел стать полезным для окружающих.И вдруг мне становится ясно: этот человек [доктор] скоро умрет. Он наверняка это знает – ему довольно посмотреться в зеркало: с каждым днем он все больше похож на свой будущий труп. Вот что такое их опыт, вот почему я часто говорю себе: от их опыта несет мертвечиной, это их последнее прибежище. Доктор очень хотел бы верить в этот свой опыт, он хотел бы скрыть от себя невыносимую правду: что он один и нет у него ни умудренности, ни прошлого, и разум его мутнеет, и тело разрушается.И чтобы хватило сил лицезреть в зеркалах свое покойницкое лицо, он пытаеться уверовать, что резец запечатлел на этом лице уроки опыта.","Знам, че никога няма да се встрастя в някого или нещо. Разбираш ли, цял подвиг е да заобичаш. Нужни са енергия, любопитство, заслепение... Има даже един момент, съвсем в началото, когато се налага да преодолееш същинска бездна. Размислиш ли, ще се откажеш. Знам, че вече никога няма да я преодолея.","Presupun că numai din lene lumea e aceeaşi de la o zi la alta.","A writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution.","Everything is silent again: but it isn't the same silence. It's raining: tapping lightly against the frosted glass windows; if there are any more masked children in the street, the rain is going to spoil their cardboard masks.","In the past - even a long while after she left me - I thought of Anny. Now I think of no one any more. I don't even bother looking for words. It flows in me, more or less quickly. I fix nothing, I let it go. Through the lack of attaching myself to words, my thoughts remain nebulous most of the time. They sketch vague, pleasant shapes and then are swallowed up: I forget them almost immediately.","I marvel at these young people: drinking their coffee, they tell clear, plausible stories. If they are asked what they did yesterday, they aren't embarrassed: they bring you up to date in a few words. If I were in their place, I'd fall over myself. It's true that no one has bothered about how I spend my time for a long while. When you live alone you no longer know what it is to tell something: the plausible disappears at the same time as the friends.","And naturally, everything they tell about in books can happen in real life, but not in the same way. It is to this way of happeningthat I clung so tightly.","One thus arrives at a curious conception of thought. Thought has no real, concrete existence, accessible to immediate consciousness, since the datum of introspection is the image. It has no universality in act, because, if it were so, one should be able to grasp it directly. But it is a potential universality that one derives from the fact that a word can be accompanied by very different images.","Our job as a writer is to represent the world and to bear witness to it.","كنت وحيدا ولكنني كنت أسير كفرقة تهبط إلى مدينة.","Var olmak susamadan içmek gibi bir şeydir.","There is nothing very new about all that; I have never rejected these harmless emotions; far from it. In order to feel them, it is sufficent to be a little isolated, just enough to get rid plausability at the right moment. But I remained close to people, on the surface of solitude, quite determined, in case of emergency, to take refuge in their midst: so far I am an amateur at heart.Now, there are objects everywhere like this glass of beer, here on the table. When I see it, I feel like saying:\"pax, I'm not playing any more\". I realize perfectly well that I have gone too far. I don't suppose you can 'make allowances' for solitude. That doesn't mean I dont look under my bed before going to sleep or that I'm afraid of seeing the door of my room open suddenly in the middle of the night. All the same I am ill at ease. For half an hour I have been avoiding looking at this glass of beer. And I know very well that all the bachelors around me can'thelp me in any way : it is too late, and i can no longer take refuge among them........... I know all that, but I know that there's something else. Almost nothing. But I can no longer explain what I see. To anybody. There it is: I am gently slipping into the water's depths, towards fear.I am alone in the midst of these happy, reasonable voices.","From these few observations we can already conclude that the real is never beautiful. Beauty is a value applicable only to the imaginary and which means the negation of the world in its essential structure.","دنیا بی‌عدالتی است، اگر قبول کنی شریک جرم می‌شوی، اگر عوض کنی جلاد می‌شوی.","And there is something that clutches the heart: the melody is absolutely untouched by this tiny coughing of the needle on the record. It is so far—so far behind. I understand that too: the disc is scratched and is wearing out, perhaps the singer is dead; I’m going to leave, I’m going to take my train. But behind the existence which falls from one present to the other, without a past, without a future, behind these sounds which decompose from day to day, peel off and slip towards death, the melody stays the same, young and firm, like a pitiless witness.","man being condemned to be free carries the weight of the whole world on his shoulders; he is responsible for the world and for himself as a way of being.","Nenhuma regra moral genérica pode indicar o que devemos fazer; não existem sinais outorgados no mundo. Os católicos replicarão: \"Mas claro que há sinais\". Admitamos, sou eu mesmo, em todo caso, que escolho o significado que eles têm. Quando eu estava preso, conheci um homem impressionante, que era jesuíta. Ele tinha entrado na ordem da seguinte forma: havia passado por uma série de infortúnios bastante dolorosos; ainda criança, seu pai foi morto, deixando-o pobre. Ele foi recebido como bolsista em uma instituição religiosa onde constantemente lhe repetiam que ele tinha sido aceito por caridade; consequentemente, ele não recebeu muitas das distinções honoríficas com que as crianças são gratificadas; depois, por volta dos dezoito anos, - coisa pueril, mas que foi a gota d'água que fez o vaso transbordar - ele foi reprovado em sua preparação militar. Portanto, esse rapaz podia achar que tudo tinha dado errado para ele; era um sinal, mas um sinal de quê? Ele podia refugiar-se na amargura ou no desespero, mas avaliou, muito habilmente para seu próprio bem, que esse era o sinal de que ele não fora feito para os triunfos seculares, e que só os êxitos da religião, da santidade e da fé é que estavam ao seu alcance. Assim, viu nisso uma mensagem divina e ingressou nas ordens. Quem não vê que a decisão do sentido do sinal foi tomada exclusivamente por ele?","In the state I was in, if someone had come and told me I could go home quietly,that they would leave me my life whole, it would have left me cold: several hours orseveral years of waiting is all the same when you have lost the illusion of being eternal.","We stay silent for a moment. Evening is coming on; I can hardly make out the pale spot of her face. Her black dress melts with the shadow which floods the room. I pick up my cup mechanically, there’s a little tea left in it and I bring it to my lips. The tea is cold. I want to smoke but I don’t dare. I have the terrible feeling that we have nothing more to say to one another.","El peligro de llevar un diario es que se exagera todo, uno esta al acecho, forzando continuamente la verdad","Every sound comes into my ears dirty because you've heard it on the way","There is no reality exception in action.","İnsanın kendi yüzünü anlayabilmesi belki de elinde değil.

Agrada-me indignar-me contra o capitalismo, mas não desejo que o suprimam, porque não teria mais motivos de indignação. Agrada-me sentir-me desdenhoso e solitário, agrada-me dizer 'não', sempre 'não', e teria medo que se tentasse construir para valer um mundo vivível porque teria que dizer 'sim' e fazer como os outros.Por cima ou por baixo: quem julgaria?","The bond between being and non-being can be only internal. It is within being qua being that non-being must arise, and within non-being that being must spring up; and this relation can not be a fact, a natural law, but an upsurge of the being which is its own nothingness of being.","Şimdi'nin gerçek özü kendini açığa vuruyordu.

Vainly I strove to compute the number of the chestnut trees, or their distance from the Velleda, or their height as compared with that of the plane trees; each of them escaped from the pattern I made for it, overflowed from it or withdrew. And I too among them, vile, languorous, obscene, chewing the cud of my thoughts, I too was superfluous. [I is you or I or anyone.] Luckily I did not feel it, I only understood it, but I felt uncomfortable because I was afraid of feeling it. . . . I thought vaguely of doing away with myself, to do away with at least one of these superfluous existences. But my death – my corpse, my blood poured out on this gravel, among these plants, in this smiling garden – would have been superfluous as well. I was superfluous to all eternity.","Gövde, bir kere yaşamaya başlayınca, bu işe kendi kendine devam eder. Ama düşünce öyle değil. Düşünceyi ben sürdürür, ben geliştiririm. Varoluşmaktayım.

А внутри мыслей – слова, оборванные слова, наметки фраз, которые возвращаются снова и снова: «Надо прекра… я суще… Смерть… Маркиз де Роль умер… Я не… Я суще…» Крутятся, крутятся, и конца им нет. Это хуже всего – потому что тут я виновник и соучастник. К примеру, эта мучительная жвачка-мысль: «Я СУЩЕСТВУЮ», ведь пережевываю ее я. Я сам. Тело, однажды начав жить, живет само по себе. Но мысль – нет; это я продолжаю, развиваю ее. Я существую. Я мыслю о том, что я существую! О-о, этот длинный серпантин, ощущение того, что я существую, – это я сам потихоньку его раскручиваю… Если бы я мог перестать мыслить!

Bir yığın tedirgin, kendinden sıkılmış var olandan başka bir şey değildik. Burada bulunmamız için tek bir neden yoktu, hiçbirimiz böyle bir neden ileri süremezdi. Utanç içinde bulunan ve belirsiz bir tedirginlik duyan her var olan, ötekilerin karşısında kendini fazlalık olarak hissediyordu. Fazlalık.","A maioria das vezes, por não se ligarem a palavras, meus pensamentos permanecem nebulosos. Desenham formas vagas e agradáveis, submergem: esqueço-os imediatamente.","Those who wants to be loved, must want the freedom of the other, because love emerges from it, if I subject it, it becomes an object, and from an object I can not receive love.","Yo no tengo tribulaciones, dispongo de dinero como un rentista, no tengo jefe, ni mujer, ni hijos; existo, eso es todo. Y esta tribulación es tan vaga, tan metafísica, que me da vergüenza.","When you want to understand something youstand in front of it, alone, without help: all the past in the world is of no use.","Man lives in the midst of images. Literature offers him a critical image of himself.","De improviso se me aparece la verdad: este hombre morirá pronto. Seguramente lo sabe; basta con que se haya mirado en un espejo; cada día se parece un poco más al cadáver que será.","Подумать только, есть глупцы, которые ищут утешения в искусстве. Вроде моей тетки Бижуа: «Прелюдии Шопена так поддержали меня, когда умер твой дядя». И концертные залы ломятся от униженных и оскорбленных, которые, закрыв глаза, тщатся превратить свои бледные лица в звукоулавливающие антенны. Они воображают, будто пойманные звуки струятся в них, сладкие и питательные, и страдания преобразуются в музыку, вроде страданий молодого Вертера; они думают, что красота им соболезнует. Кретины.","الحياة تبدأ من اليأس","When I can't see myself I begin to wonder if I really and truly exist. I pat myself just to make sure, but it doesn't help much.","Я тоже хотел БЫТЬ. Собственно, ничего другого я не хотел — вот она, разгадка моей жизни; в недрах всех моих начинаний, которые кажутся хаотичными, я обнаруживаю одну неизменную цель: изгнать из себя существование, избавить каждую секунду от жировых наслоений, выжать ее, высушить, самому очиститься, отвердеть, чтобы издать наконец четкий и точный звук ноты саксофона.","Não nos mostra ele que o \"costume\" e o \"divertimento\" mascaram ao homem \"o seu nada, o seu abandono, a sua insuficiência, a sua impotência e o seu vazio\"?","¡Qué tonto eres! Naturalmente, no he necesitado verte, si eso es lo que quieres decir. Ya sabes que no tienes nada regocijante para los ojos. Necesito que existas y que no cambies. Eres como ese metro de platino que se conserva en alguna parte, en París o en los alrededores. No creo que nadie haya tenido deseos de verlo.","The Intellectual is someone who meddles in what does not concern him.","دنیای بی عدالتی استاگر قبولش کنی شریک جرم می شویو اگر بخواهی عوضش کنی جلاد می شوی","If I am not mistaken, if all the signs which have been amassed are precursors of a new overthrow in my life, well then I am terrified. It isn't that my life is rich, or weighty or precious. But I'm afraid of what will be born and take possession of me—and drag me—where? Shall I have to go off again, leaving my research, my book and everything else unfinished? Shall I awake in a few months, in a few years, broken, deceived, in the midst of new ruins? I would like to see the truth clearly before it is too late.","Steden maken me bang. Maar waag je niet te ver buiten hun muren, want dan betreed je het domein van de Vegetatie. Over een afstand van vele kilometers is de Vegetatie opgerukt in de richting van de steden. Ze ligt op de loer. Als de stad dood is, neemt de vegetatie de macht over. Ze zal zich langs de muren omhoogslingeren en ze overwoekeren, ze zal in all hoeken en gaten doordringen en de stenen uit elkaar laten spatten; ze zal alle holen dichten en overal zullen groene vangarmen naar beneden hangen.","I go out. Why? Well,because I have no reason not to go out either","Nothing happens while you live. The scenery changes, people come in and go out, that’s all. There are no beginnings. Days are tacked on to days without rhyme or reason, an interminable, monotonous addition.","I wanted the moments of my life to follow and order themselves like those of a life remembered.","The existent individual, as Kierkegaard defines him, is first of all he who is in an infinite relationship with himself and has an infinite interest in himself and his destiny. Secondly, the existent individual always feels himself to be in Becoming, with a task before him;","Many people are walking along the shore, turning poetic springtime faces towards the sea; they're having a holiday because of the sun. [...] The true sea is cold and black, full of animals; it crawls under this thin green film made to deceive human beings.","My memories are like coins in the devil’s purse: when you open it you find only dead leaves.","If you’re lonely when you’re alone, you’re in bad company. – Jean-Paul Sartre”","El hombre no es nada más que su proyecto, no existe más que en la medida en que se realiza, no es, por lo tanto, más que el conjunto de sus actos, nada más que su vida.","The only being which can be called free is the being which nihilates its being.","The vegetation has crawled mile for mile towards the towns. It is waiting. When the town dies, the Vegetation will invade it, it will clamber over the stones, it will grip them, search them, burst them open with its long black pincers; it will bind the holes and hang its green paws everywhere.","Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does. It is up to you to give [life] a meaning. – Jean-Paul Sartre”","Varlığı bir rezaletti ve daha sonra üstüne alacağı sorumluluklar bu rezaleti doğrulamaya yetecekti.","El criminal no hace la belleza; él mismo es la auténtica belleza.","Я начал свою жизнь, как, по всей вероятности, и кончу ее - среди книг.","La función del escritor consiste en obrar de modo que nadie pueda ignorar el mundo y que nadie pueda ante el mundo decirse inocente","My odd feelings of the other week seem to me quite ridiculous today: I can no longer enter into them.","Every human reality is a passion in that it projects losing itself so as to found being and by the same stroke to constitute the In-itself which escapes contingency by being its own foundation, the Ens causa sui,which religions call God. Thus the passion of man is the reverse of that of Christ, for man loses himself as man in order that God may be born. But the idea of God is contradictory and we lose ourselves in vain. Man is a useless passion.","Il y a quelque chose de coincé dans le mécanisme","If I remember correctly, they call that the irreversibility of time. The feeling of adventure would simply be that of the irreversibility of time. But why don't we always have it? Is it that time is not always irreversible? There are moments when you have the impression that you can do what you want, go forward or backward, that it has no importance; and then other times when you might say that the links have been tightened and, in that case, it's not a question of missing your turn because you could never start again.","But you have to choose: live or tell.","The four cafés on the Boulevard Victor-Noir, shining in the night, side by side, and which are much more than café--aquariums, ships, stars or great white eyes--have lost their ambiguous charm.","... Partiye girme kararını vermeden önce öyle korkunç bir yalnızlık duyuyordum ki, canıma kıymayı bile düşünmüştüm. Bu işten caymamın nedeni ölümümden kimsenin duygulanmayacağı, ölümde, hayatta olduğumdan daha yalnız olacağımı düşünmemdir.","I am sure that fifteen minutes would be enough to reach supreme self-contempt. No thank you, I want none of that.","Yapayalnızım, ama kentin üzerine yürüyen bir ordu gibiyim.","Yalnızım. İnsanların çoğu evlerine girdiler. Biten bir pazarın ağızlarında bıraktığı tatla, daha şimdiden bir sonraki pazarı düşünüyorlar. Benim içinse ne pazar var, ne de pazartesi.Karanlıklar içinde birbirini iteleyen günler ve birde bunun gibi şimşekler var. Değişen hiçbir şey yok, ama yine de her şey başka biçimde varolup gidiyor. Anlatamam. Yazamam. Bulantıya benziyor. Ama aynı zaman onun tam tersi.","Nothing has changed and yet everything is different. I can’t describe it; it’s like the Nausea and yet it’s just the opposite: at last an adventure happens to me and when I question myself I see that it happens that I am myself and that I am here; I am the one who splits the night, I am as happy as the hero of a novel.","Paris was dead. More cars, more pedestrians—except at certain hours in certain quarters. We walked between the cobblestones; it appeared that we were the forgotten members of an immense exodus. A bit of provincial life was caught on the sharp angles of the capital; it remained a skeleton city, pompous and immobile, too long and too big for us: too large, the streets that we discovered as far as the eye could see, too great the distances, too vast the perspectives: we got lost.","When you want to understand something you stand in front of it, alone, without help: all the past in the world is of no use.","Anyhow, it is a definite colour: I am glad I have red hair. There is it is in the mirror, it makes itself seen, it shines. I am still lucky if my forehead was surmounted by one of those neutral heads of hair which are neither chestnut not blond, my face would be lost in vagueness, it would make me dizzy.","Hayır, böylesine acı çekme gücünü kendinden almıyor o. Bu güç ona dışarıdan geliyor...Şu bulvardan. Kolundan tutup ışığa, insanların arasına, pespembe sokaklara götürmeli onu. Orada böyle acı çekilmez, yumuşayıverir, güven dolu halini bulur ve her zamanki acılarının düzeyine iner.","Ağacın çevresinde depreşip duran bütün bu var olanlar, hiçbir yerden gelmiyor ve hiçbir yere gitmiyorlardı. Birden var oluyorlar ve sonra birden varoluştan kesiliyorlardı: Varoluş bellekten yoksundur, kaybolmuşlarla ilgili tek bir anısı bile yoktur. Her yanda varoluş, bitimsiz, fazladan, her yerde ve her zaman varoluş; ancak yine varoluşla sınırlanan varoluş!","Вкрадчивая кровавая тяга к насилию подкрадывается ко мне сзади, она где то за ушами, уши волочатся следом за мной, рыжие волосы, они рыжеют на моей голове, влажная трава, рыжая трава – это что, тоже я?","I lean all my weight on the porcelain ledge, I draw my face closer until it touches the mirror. The eyes, nose and mouth disappear: nothing human is left. Brown wrinkles show on each side of the feverish swelled lips, crevices, mole holes. A silky white down covers the great slopes of the cheeks, two hairs protrude from the nostrils: it is a geological embossed map. And, in spite of everything, this lunar world is familiar to me. I cannot say I RECOGNIZE the details. But the whole thing gives me an impression of something seen before which stupefies me: I slip quietly off to sleep.","Existence is without memory; of the vanished it retains nothing - not even a memory.","By extending the idea of natural law to the economic sphere - an inevitable but fundamental error - they (18th century philosophes) both secularized the economy and converted it into a domain external to man: a system of inflexible laws whose constraints permitted no modification.","Consciousness does not know its own character -- unless in determining itself reflectively from the standpoint of another's point of view. It exists its character in pure distinction non-thematically and non-thetically in the proof which it effects of its own contingency and in the nihilation by which it recognizes and surpasses its facticity. This is why pure introspective self-description does not give us character. Proust's hero 'does not have' a directly apprehensible character; he is presented first as being conscious of himself as an ensemble of general reactions common to all men...in which each man can recognise himself. This is because these reactions belong to the general 'nature' of the psychic.","Ben onun gibi umutsuz değilim, çünkü beklediğim fazla bir şey yok. Ben daha çok...bana verilmiş, hem de bir hiç için verilmiş olan hayat karşısında şaşırmış durumdayım.","Į žmones reikia žiūrėti iš aukštai. Būdavo, užgesinu šviesą ir atsistoju prie lango: jie nė neįtaria, kad juos galima stebėti ir iš viršaus. Jie rūpinasi savo priekiu, kartais užpakaliu, bet visi jų triukai skirti metro setyniasdešimties centimetrų ūgio žiūrovui. O ar kas nors kada pagalvojo, kaip atrodo katiliuko formos kepurė žvelgiant iš septinto aukšto? <...> Vieną vakarą man toptelėjo mintis pašaudyti į žmones.","No era el aire miserable de aquel tipo lo que nos daba miedo, ni el tumor que tenía en el pescuezo y que el borde del cuello postizo rozaba; sentíamos que elaboraba en su cabeza pensamientos de cangrejo o langosta. Y nos aterrorizaba que pudieran concebirse pensamientos de langosta...","Perhaps it is impossible to understand one's own face. Or perhaps it is because I am a single man? People who live in society have learned how to see themselves in mirrors as they appear to their friends. I have no friends. Is that why my flesh is so naked? You might say--yes, you might say, nature without humanity.","I do not think therefore I am a moustache.","U mojim rukama, na primer, ima nečeg novog, izvestan način na koji uzimam lulu ili viljušku. Ili pak sad viljuška ima izvestan način na koji se da uzeti, ne znam.","His blue cotton shirt stands out joyfully against a chocolate-coloured wall. That too brings on the Nausea. The Nausea is not inside me: I feel it OUT THERE in the wall, in the suspenders, everywhere around me. It makes itself one with the café, I am the one who is within IT.","Men all alone, completely alone with horrible monstrosities, will run through the streets, pass heavily in front of me, their eyes staring, fleeing their ills yet carrying with them, open-mouthed, with their insect-tongue flapping its wings. Then I'll burst out laughing even though my body may be covered with filthy, infected scabs which blossom into flowers of flesh, violets, buttercups.","E ora şapte şi jumătate, nu mi-e foame şi filmul începe abia la nouă; ce-aş putea face? Trebuie să merg repede, ca să mă încălzesc. Ezit: în spatele meu bulevardul duce în inima oraşului, către podoabele de foc ale străzilor centrale, la Palatul Paramount, la Imperial, la Marile Magazine Jahan. Nu mă atrage deloc: e ora aperitivului; fiinţele, cânii, oamenii, toate aceste mase moi care se mlşcă spontan, le-am văzut destul pentru moment.","The English and the French have not a single memory in common. Everything that London suffered with pride, Paris suffered in shame and despair. It is important for us to learn to speak of ourselves without emotion,","Hayatımın anlarının, hatırlanan bir hayatın anları gibi birbirini izlemesini istemiştim. Zamanı kuyruğundan yakalamaya kalkışmanın böyle bir önemi olabilirdi.","Nu-mi simt trupul, m-a cucerit puritatea lucrurilor care mă înconjoară; nimic nu e viu; vântul suflă, linii drepte aleargă în noapte.","One always dies too soon - or too late. And yet one's whole life is complete at that moment, with a line drawn neatly under it, ready for the summing up. You are - your life, and nothing else.","could we not conceive of a philosophy of existence linked, not solely to experiences of separation, forlornness, and profound melancholy, but also to feelings of hope and confidence?","To forget about the others? How utterly absurd! I feel you there, in every pore. Your silence clamors in my ears. You can nail up your mouth, cut your tongue out - but you can't prevent your being there.","Şu tepenin üstünde, kendimi onlardan ne kadar uzak hissediyorum. Sanki başka türdenim ben. Bütün gün çalıştıktan sonra bürolardan çıkıyor, evlere ve meydanlara neşeyle bakıp, bu kentin, kendi kentleri olduğunu, bir 'güzel burjuva kenti' niteliği taşıdığını düşünüyorlar. Korkmuyorlar; kendi yurtlarında olduklarını duyuyorlar. Musluklardan akan evcil kent suyundan, düğme çevrilince ampullerden yayılan ışıktan, dayanaklarla desteklenmiş melez ağaçlardan başka şey bilmezler. Her şeyin bir mekanizmaya uyarak ortaya çıktığını, dünyanın belli ve değişmez yasalara göre işlediğini günde yüz kere görürler: Boşlukta, bütün nesneler aynı hızla düşer; park yazın her gün saat altıda, kışın da dörtte kapanır; kurşun 335 derecede erir; son tramvay Hotel de Ville'den on biri beş geçe kalkar. Durgun, biraz asık suratlı kimselerdir. Yarın'ı, yani bugünün bir tekrarını düşünürler; kentlerde her sabah yeniden orataya çıkan tek bir gün vardır. Pazarları, bu tek günü az buçuk süslerler. Avanaklar! Güven dolu, kalın suratlarını göreceğimi düşündükçe tiksinti kaplıyor içimi. Yasalar yaparlar, bayağı romanlar yazarlar, çocuk yapma budalalığına düşmekten kurtulamazlar. Ama o koskoca, ne idüğü belirsiz doğa, kentlerine girmiş, her tarafa, evlerine, bürolarına, kendilerine bile sızmıştır. Doğa kıpırdamaz, olduğu gibi durur; onlar, içleri dolduğu, doğayı soludukları halde farkında değillerdir. Kentin dışında, yirmi kilometre uzakta olduğunu sanırlar doğanın. Onu görüyorum ben,bu doğayı görüyorum. Baş eğişinin tembellikten geldiğini biliyorum; yasaları olmadığını da biliyorum, onun düzenliliği sandıkları şey...Doğanın alışkanlıkları var yalnız, yarın değiştirebilir onları.","Though impervious to the sacred, I loved magic. The cinema was a suspect appearance that I loved perversely for what it still lacked. That streaming was everything, it was nothing, it was everything reduced to nothing.","Yeryüzünde şu serüven duygusu kadar bağlı olduğum başka şey yok belki. Ama bu duygu istediği zaman geliyor, sonra hemen kaçıp gidiyor. Gittiği zaman nasıl bomboş kalıyorum. Yoksa hayatımı boşa harcadığımı anlatmak için mi bu kısa ve alaycı ziyaretleri yapıyor bana?Ardımda, kentin içinde, geniş ve dümdüz yollarda, lambaların soğuk aydınlığında, yaman bir toplumsal olay can çekişiyordu, pazar gününün bitişiydi bu.","I've dropped out of their hearts like a little sparrow fallen from its nest.","A search for justification and the impossibility of justification are recurrent motifs in the philosophy of Sartre. His philosophy is one of the incarnations of problematism and of the ambiguity of contemporary thought (for Man does seem, to the contemporary mind, to be ambiguous).","Дальше я не слушаю – они меня раздражают. Они будут спать вместе. Они это знают. Каждый из них знает, что другой это знает.","Lecturile Autodidactului mă pun în încurcătură întotdeauna. Brusc, îmi revin în minte numele ultimilor autori pe care i-a consultat: Lambert, Langlois, Larbaletrier, Lastex, Lavergne. Dintr-o străfulgerare am înţeles metoda Autodidactului: se instruieşte în ordine alfabetică. Il contemplu cu un fel de admiraţie. Cîtă voinţă îi trebuie ca să realizeze încetul cu încetul, cu încăpăţînare, un proiect atît de vast? Într-o zi, acum şapte ani (mi-a mărturisit că studiază de şapte ani) a intrat cu mare pompă în această sală. A parcurs cu privirea nenumăratele cărţi care acoperă pereţii şi probabil a spus, asemenea lui Rastignac: «Intre noi doi acum, Cunoaştere omenească!» S-a dus apoi să ia prima carte din primul raft de la extrema dreaptă; a deschis-o la prima pagină cu un sentiment de respect şi de teamă, însoţit cu o hotărîre de neclintit. Astăzi se află la L. A trecut deodată de la studiul coleopterelor la cel al teoriei cuantelor. A citit tot; a înmagazinat în capul lui jumătate din ce se ştie despre partenogeneză, jumătate din argumentele împotriva vivisecţiei. În urma lui, înaintea lui, e un univers. Şi se apropie ziua cînd va spune, închizînd ultimul volum din ultimul raft de la extrema stîngă: «Şi acum?»","Antes de alguém viver, a vida, em si mesma, não é nada; é quem é a vive que deve dar-lhe um sentido; e o valor nada mais que constatar-se, assim, que é possível criar uma comunidade humana.","Revolutionary man must be a contingent being, unjustifiable but free, entirely immersed in the society that oppresses him, but capable of transcending this society by his effort to change it. Idealism mystifies him in that it binds him by rights and values that are already given; it conceals from him his power to devise roads of his own. But materialism also mystifies him, by depriving him of his freedom. The revolutionary philosophy must be a philosophy of transcendence.","O existencialismo não é tanto um ateísmo no sentido em que se esforçaria por demonstrar que Deus não existe. Ele declara, mais exatamente: mesmo que Deus existisse, nada mudaria; eis o nosso ponto de vista. Não que acreditemos que deus exista, mas pensamos que o problema não é o da sua existência; é preciso que o homem se reencontre e se convença de que nada pode salvá-lo dele próprio, nem mesmo uma prova válida da existência de Deus.","میخاهم بروم.به جایی بروم که واقعا جای من باشد.جایی که با آن جور در بیایم...","به این فکر کردم که برای اینکه یک واقعۀ پیش پا افتاده تبدیل به ماجرا شود، کافی است و لازم است که آن را تعریف کنم. این همان چیزی است که مردم را گول می زند، آدم همیشه قصه گوست. با قصه های خودش و دیگران زندگی می کند. هرچه را که برایش رخ می دهد، از خلال همین قصه ها می بیند و تلاش می کند طوری زندگی کند که انگار دارد آن را نقل می کند.ولی باید بین زندگی و قصه گویی یکی را انتخاب کند.","Ötekilere yalan söylemesinden hoşlanıyordum.

Days are tacked on to days without rhyme or reason, an interminable, monotonous addition. (. . .) There are moments—rarely—when you make a landmark, you realize that you’re going with a woman, in some messy business. The time of a flash. After that, the procession starts again, you begin to add up hours and days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. April, May, June. 1924, 1925, 1926 (. . .) That’s living. [Everything] changes when you tell about life; it’s a change no one notices.","The letters I had inscribed on it were not even dry yet and already they belonged to the past.","Een mens engageert zich in zijn leven, krijgt daarin gestalte en buiten die gestalte is er niets. Voor iemand die in zijn leven niet geslaagd is, moet dat natuurlijk een harde gedachte zijn. Maar anderzijds stelt ze de mensen in staat te begrijpen dat alleen de werkelijkheid telt, dat dromen, afwachten en hopen een mens tot niet meer dan een teleurgestelde droom, een vervlogen hoop, een vergeefse verwachting maken.","Et voilà, mon passé n’est plus qu’un trou énorme. Mon présent: cette bonne au corsage noir qui rêve près du comptoir, ce petit bonhomme. Tout ce que je sais de ma vie, il me semble que je l’ai appris dans des livres.","But the end is there, transforming everything. For us, the man is already the hero of the story.

In other words, there is no determinism, man is free, man is freedom. On the other hand, if God does not exist, we find no values or commands to turn to which legitimize our conduct. So, in the bright realm of values, we have no excuse behind us, nor justification before us. We are alone, with no excuses.","Je ne pourrai jamais m'assesoir dessus, c'est une catastrophe: Je suis en bleue clair et il est vert épinard.","Neither sad nor gay is the desert—a boundless waste of sand under a burning waste of sky.","پولدارهای شهر بر ضد اسقف اعظم که ارباب پولدار آنهاست شورش کرده‌اند، وقتی پولدارها باهم می‌جنگند فقیرها باید کشته بشوند.","Понимаешь, начать кого-нибудь любить - это целое дело.

Serpent or claw or root or vulture's talon, what difference does it make.

But neither does a circle exist. This root, on the other hand, existed in such a way that I could not explain it. Knotty, inert, nameless, it fascinated me, filled my eyes, brought me back unceasingly to its own existence. In vain to repeat: \"This is a root\"—it didn't work any more. I saw clearly that you could not pass from its function as a root, as a breathing pump, to that, to this hard and compact skin of a sea lion, to this oily, callous, headstrong look. The function explained nothing: it allowed you to understand generally that it was a root, but not that one at all. This root, with its colour, shape, its congealed movement, was . . . below all explanation. Each of its qualities escaped it a little, flowed out of it, half solidified, almost became a thing; each one was In the way in the root and the whole stump now gave me the impression of unwinding itself a little, denying its existence to lose itself in a frenzied excess.","So a change has taken place during these last few weeks. But where? It is an abstract change without object. Am I the one who has changed? If not, then it is this room, this city and this nature; I must choose. I think I’m the one who has changed: that’s the simplest solution. Also the most unpleasant. But I must finally realize that I am subject to these sudden transformations. The thing is that I rarely think; a crowd of small metamorphoses accumulate in me without my noticing it, and then, one fine day, a veritable revolution takes place. This is what has given my life such a jerky, incoherent aspect.","I scraped my heel against this black claw: I wanted to peel off some of the bark. For no reason at all, out of defiance, to make the bare pink appear absurd on the tanned leather: to play with the absurdity of the world.

When they ran quickly under your nose like startled hares and you didn't pay too much attention, you might believe them to be simple and reassuring, you might believe that there was real blue in the world, real red, a real perfume of almonds or violets. But as soon as you held on to them for an instant, this feeling of comfort and security gave way to a deep uneasiness: colours, tastes, and smells were never real, never themselves and nothing butthemselves.","If anyone had asked me what existence was, I would have answered, in good faith, that it was nothing, simply an empty form which was added to external things without changing anything in their nature. And then all of a sudden, there it was, clear as day: existence had suddenly unveiled itself. It had lost the harmless look of an abstract category: it was the very paste of things, this root was kneaded into existence. Or rather the root, the park gates, the bench, the sparse grass, all that had vanished: the diversity of things, their individuality, were only an appearance, a veneer. This veneer had melted, leaving soft, monstrous masses, all in disorder—naked, in a frightful, obscene nakedness.","The simplest, most indefinable quality had too much content, in relation to itself, in its heart.","But this richness was lost in confusion and finally was no more because it was too much.","I am the Thing.

As if there could possibly be true stories; things happen one way and we tell about them in the opposite sense. You seem to start at the beginning: \"It was a fine autumn evening in 1922. I was a notary's clerk in Marommes.\" And in reality you have started at the end. It was there, invisible and present, it is the one which gives to words the pomp and value of a beginning. \"I was out walking, I had left the town without realizing it, I was thinking about my money troubles.\" This sentence, taken simply for what it is, means that the man was absorbed, morose, a hundred leagues from an adventure, exactly in the mood to let things happen without noticing them. But the end is there, transforming everything. For us, the man is already the hero of the story. His moroseness, his money troubles are much more precious than ours, they are all gilded by the light of future passions. And the story goes on in the reverse: instants have stopped piling themselves in lighthearted way one on top of the other, they are snapped up by the end of the story which draws them and each of them in turn, draws out the preceding instant. \"it was night, the street was deserted.\" The phrase is cast out negligently, it seems superfluous; but we do not let ourselves be caught and we put it aside: this a piece of information whose value we shall subsequently appreciate. And we feel that the hero has lived all the details of this night like annunciations, promises, or even that he lived only those that were promises, blind and deaf to all that did not herald adventure. We forget that the future was not yet there; the man was walking in a night without forethought, a night which offered him a choice of due rich prizes, and he did not make his choice.","Je ne suis ni le maître ni l'esclave, Jupiter. Je suis ma liberté! À peine m'as-tu créé que j'ai cessé de t'appartenir","I thought it was so stupid, so out of place, I hated this ignoble mess. Mounting up, mounting up as high as the sky, spilling over, filling everything with its gelatinous slither, and I could see depths upon depths of it reaching far beyond the limits of the garden, the houses, and Bouville, as far as the eye could reach. I was no longer in Bouville, I was nowhere, I was floating. I was not surprised, I knew it was the World, the naked World suddenly revealing itself, and I choked with rage at this gross, absurd being. You couldn’t even wonder where all that sprang from, or how it was that a world came into existence, rather than nothingness. It didn’t make sense, the World was everywhere, in front, behind. There had been nothing before it. Nothing. There had never been a moment in which it could not have existed. That was what worried me: of course there was no reason for this flowing larva to exist. But it was impossible for it is not to exist. It was unthinkable: to imagine nothingness you had to be there already, in the midst of the World, eyes wide open and alive; nothingness was only an idea in my head, an existing idea floating in this immensity: this nothingness had not come before existence, it was an existence like any other and appeared after many others.","All was fullness and all was active, there was no weakness in time, all, even the least perceptible stirring, was made of existence. And all these existents which bustled about this tree came from nowhere and were going nowhere.","El amor es una gran cosa poética que es preciso no espantar.","به جاي تسلط بر جهان بايد بر خويشتن مسلط شد","If people throw up to us our works of fiction in which we write about people who are soft, weak, cowardly, and sometimes even downright bad, it's not be. cause these people are soft, weak, cowardly, or bad; because if we were to say, as Zola did, that they are that way because of heredity, the workings of environment, society, because of biological or psychological determinism, people would be reassured. They would say, \"Well, that's what we're like, no one can doanything about it.\" But when the existentialist writes about a coward, he says that this coward is responsible for his cowardice. He's not like that because he has a cowardly heart or lung or brain; he's not like that on account of his physiological make-up; but he's like that because he has made himself a coward by his acts. There's no such thing as a cowardly constitution; there are nervous constitutions; there is poor blood, as the common people say, or strong constitutions. But the man whose blood is poor is not a coward on that account, for what makes cowardice is the act of renouncing or yielding. A constitution is not an act; the coward is defined on the basis of the acts he performs. People feel, in a vague sort of way, that this coward we're talking about is guilty of being a coward, and the thought frightens them. What people would like is that a coward or a hero be born that way.","The only difference between image and idea is thus that in the one case, the expression of the object is confused, and in the other, it is clear. The confusion comes from this: every movement envelops in itself the infinity of the movements of the universe; and the brain receives an infinity of modifications to which only a confused thought can correspond, enveloping the infinity of clear ideas that would correspond to each detail. Clear ideas are therefore contained in the confused ideas. They are unconscious; they are perceived without being apperceived. Only their sum total is apperceived; this appears simple to us because of our ignorance of its components.","We still have not defined the intellectual yet: all we have are technicians of practical knowledge who either accommodate themselves to their contradiction or manage to avoid suffering from it. But when one of them becomes aware of the fact that despite the universality of his work it serves only particular interests, then his awareness of this contradiction - what Hegel called an 'unhappy consciousness' - is precisely what characterizes him as an intellectual.","¿Cómo yo, que no he tenido fuerzas para retener mi propio pasado puedo esperar que salvaré el de otro?","Thirdly, the existent individual is impassioned, impassioned with a passionate thought; he is inspired; he is a kind of incarnation of the infinite in the finite. This passion which animates the existent (and this brings us to the fourth characteristic) is what Kierkegaard calls “the passion of freedom.","I can’t explain what I see. To anyone. There: I am quietly slipping into the water’s depths, towards fear. I am alone in the midst of these happy, reasonable voices.

Bu bir kıssa konusu bile olabilir. Şöyle anlatabiliriz: Yanlış dünyaya gelmiş bir zavallı vardı. Öteki insanlar gibi, parkların, kahvelerin, ticaret kentlerinin dünyasında var olup gidiyor ve tabloların ardından Tintoretto'nun devlet adamları, Gozzoli'nin cesur Floransalarıyla; kitap sayfalarının ardında Fabrice del Dongo ve Julien Sorel ile gramofon plaklarının ardında kupkuru, uzun caz yakarışlarıyla birlikte, bambaşka dünyalarda yaşadığına kendini inandırmak istiyordu. İyice sersemlik ettikten sonra durumu kavradı; artık gözleri açılmıştı, bunda bir yanlışlık olduğunu anladı; aslında bir kahvede, bir bardak ılık biranın karşısındaydı. Oturduğu yerde ne yapacağını bilmeden kaldı; 'Ben bir budalayım,' diye düşündü. Tam bu sırada, varoluşun öbür yakasında, ancak uzaktan görülebilen ve yaklaşılamayan öteki dünyada, ufak bir melodi dans etmeye, şarkı söylemeye başladı. 'Benim gibi olmak, ölçüyle acı çekmek gerek.'Ses söylüyor:Some of these daysYou'll miss me honeyPlağın burası çizilmiş olmalı, cızırdayıp duruyor. Ama insanın içini daraltan bir şey var. O da şu: İğnenin plak üzerinde öyle kısaca öksürmesi, melodiye hiç dokunmuyor. Melodi öyle uzakta ki! Bunu da anlıyorum, plak çizik olup eskiyebilir, şarkıcı kadın belki de ölmüştür, ben birazdan buradan ayrılıp trenime bineceğim. Ama bir şimdi'den öteki şimdi'ye düşen geçmişsiz ve geleceksiz varoluş ardında, her gün biraz daha ayrışan, pul pul dökülen ve ölüme doğru kayan şu seslerin ardında melodi, hiç değişmeden, sımsıkı ve genç bir halde acımasız bir tanık gibi duruyor.(...)Zenci kadın söylüyor.

Perhaps this is what I liked best in her, this austere loyalty to her most insignificant features.","От кого? От какво е този блудкаво-горчив вкус в устата ми? От човека? От звяра? От мен?

And explode it does, as you and I know. And we live in an age of conflagration: it only needs the rising birth rate to worsen the food shortage, it only needs the newly born to fear living a little more than dying, and for the torrent of violence to sweep away all the barriers. In Algeria and Angola, Europeans are massacred on sight. This is the age of the boomerang, the third stage of violence: it flies right back at us, it strikes us and, once again, we have no idea what hit us. The \"liberals\" remain stunned: they admit we had not been polite enough to the \"natives,\" that it would have been wiser and fairer to grant them certain rights, wherever possible; they would have been only too happy to admit them in batches without a sponsor to that exclusive club -- the human species; and now this barbaric explosion of madness is putting them in the same boat as the wretched colonists. The metropolitan Left is in a quandary: it is well aware of the true fate of the \"natives,\" the pitiless oppression they are subjected to, and does not condemn their revolt, knowing that we did everything to provoke it. But even so, it thinks, there are limits: these guerrillas should make every effort to show some chivalry; this would be the best way of proving they are men. Sometimes the Left berates them: \"You're going too far; we cannot support you any longer.\" They don't care a shit for its support; it can shove it up its ass for what it's worth. As soon as the war began, they realized the harsh truth: we are all equally as good as each other. We have all taken advantage of them, they have nothing to prove, they won't give anyone preferential treatment. A single duty, a single objective: drive out colonialism by every means. And the most liberal among us would be prepared to accept this, at a pinch, but they cannot help seeing in this trial of strength a perfectly inhuman method used by subhumans to claim for themselves a charter for humanity: let them acquire it as quickly as possible, but in order to merit it, let them use nonviolent methods.

Era un porvenir falso, una impostura. Contemplaba esos veinte años que viviera de pie, soleados, una llanura marina, y los veía ahora como habían sido: un número determinado de jornadas comprimidas entre dos altos muros sin esperanza, un periodo catalogado, con un comienzo y un fin, que figuraría en los manuales de historia con el nombre de periodo entre dos guerras. Veinte años: 1918 - 1938 ¡Sólo veinte años! Ayer aquello parecía a la vez más corto y más largo; de todas maneras, a nadie se le hubiera ocurrido contarlo, puesto que no había terminado. Ahora, estaba terminado. Era un porvenir falso. Todo cuanto uno viviera durante esos años, lo había vivido en falso.

When a tyrant falls, when an occupying army is ousted, when an oppressive regime gives way to a free and democratic order, a new day does not dawn. Triumphant speeches by new leaders may distract attention from the problems facing the liberated country; victory parades or spontaneous celebrations in the streets for a time may obscure deep divisions within the newly free society. But any occupation leaves scars on a nation’s psyche. The complicity of some with the former rulers, the persecution of others at the hands of their fellow citizens, courageous acts of resistance offset by the passivity of the majority of the population—only by facing these shameful features of its subjugation can the liberated nation achieve harmony, heal its wounds, and regain legitimacy in the eyes of the outside world.","When Sartre wrote “Paris Under the Occupation, the dead were still being mourned while the fate of prisoners of war and the deported remained unknown. Shortages of food and raw materials, a crippled transportation system, rampant inflation, and a thriving black market were sources of great unrest. Months before the Liberation, the settling of scores had begun.”","I feel so far away from them, on the top of this hill. It seems as though I belong to another species. They come out of their offices after their day of work, they look at the houses and the squares with satisfaction, they think it is their city, a good, solid, bourgeois city. They aren’t afraid, they feel at home. All they have ever seen is trained water running from taps, light which fills bulbs when you turn on the switch, half-breed, bastard trees held up with crutches. They have proof, a hundred times a day, that everything happens mechanically, that the world obeys fixed, unchangeable laws. In a vacuum all bodies fall at the same rate of speed, the public park is closed at 4 p.m. in winter, at 6 p.m. in summer, lead melts at 335 degrees centigrade, the last streetcar leaves the Hotel de Ville at 11.05 p.m. They are peaceful, a little morose, they think about Tomorrow, that is to say, simply, a new today; cities have only one day at their disposal and every morning it comes back exactly the same. They scarcely doll it up a bit on Sundays. Idiots. It is repugnant to me to think that I am going to see their thick, self-satisfied faces. They make laws, they write popular novels, they get married, they are fools enough to have children. And all this time, great, vague nature has slipped into their city, it has infiltrated everywhere, in their house, in their office, in themselves. It doesn’t move, it stays quietly and they are full of it inside, they breathe it, and they don’t see it, they imagine it to be outside, twenty miles from the city. I see it, I see this nature . . . I know that its obedience is idleness, I know it has no laws: what they take for constancy is only habit and it can change tomorrow.What if something were to happen? What if something suddenly started throbbing? Then they would notice it was there and they’d think their hearts were going to burst. Then what good would their dykes, bulwarks, power houses, furnaces and pile drivers be to them?

А над фаллосами будут кружиться птицы и клевать их своими клювами, и из них будет сочиться кровь.

And birds will fly around these birch trees and pick at them with their beaks and make them bleed. Sperm will flow slowly, gently, from these wounds, sperm mixed with blood, warm and glassy with little bubbles. Or else nothing like that will happen, there will be no appreciable change, but one morning people will open their blinds and be surprised by a sort of frightful sixth sense, brooding heavily over things and seeming to pause. Nothing more than that: but for the little time it lasts, there will be hundreds of suicides. Yes! Let it change just a little, just to see, I don’t ask for anything better. Then you will see other people, suddenly plunged into solitude. Men all alone, completely alone with horrible monstrosities, will run through the streets, pass heavily in front of me, their eyes staring, fleeing their ills yet carrying them with them, open-mouthed, with their insect-tongue flapping its wings. Then I’ll burst out laughing even though my body may be covered with filthy, infected scabs which blossom into flowers of flesh, violets, buttercups. I’ll lean against a wall and when they go by I’ll shout: “What’s the matter with your science? What have you done with your humanism? Where is your dignity? I will not be afraid—or at least no more than now. Will it not still be existence, variations on existence? All these eyes which will slowly devour a face—they will undoubtedly be too much, but no more so than the first two, Existence is what I am afraid of.”","şu son haftalar içinde bir değişiklik ortaya çıktı. ama nerede? hiçbir şeye bağlanılmayan soyut bir değişme bu. değişen ben miyim? ben değilsem şu oda, şu kent, şu doğa; seçmek gerek.değişen benim sanıyorum.","Sartre’s reputation as France’s preeminent moral spokesman during the postwar period is rather tarnished these days. In 1941 he had no qualms about accepting a post at a prestigious lycée that came vacant when its previous occupant, a Jew, was dismissed by the Vichy authorities. His contribution to the Resistance was slight—he wrote articles for underground papers but took few risks—and his subversive play The Flies could not have been produced without the approval of the German censors. To undermine the heroism of resistance fighters appears self-serving, and coming from a man who was not a devout Catholic, the claim that Resistance fighters were willing martyrs is simply bizarre.","Dans la rue des Blancs-ManteauxIls ont élevé des tréteauxEt mis du son dans un seauEt c'était un échafaudDans la rue des Blancs-ManteauxDans la rue des Blancs-ManteauxLe bourreau s'est levé tôtC'est qu'il avait du boulotFaut qu'il coupe des générauxDes évêques, des amiraux,Dans la rue des Blancs-ManteauxDans la rue des Blancs-ManteauxSont v'nues des dames comme il fautAvec de beaux affûtiauxMais la tête leur f'sait défautElle avait roulé d'son hautLa tête avec le chapeauDans l'ruisseau des Blancs-Manteaux","God, how strongly things exist today.","No street corner has any justification over another one.

A little while ago someone said “me,” said my consciousness. Who? Outside there were streets, alive with known smells and colours. Now nothing is left but anonymous walls, anonymous consciousness. That is what there is: walls, and between the walls, a small transparency, alive and impersonal. Consciousness exists as a tree, as a blade of grass. It slumbers, it grows bored.

It passes slowly, full of blood, spattered, and its bulging eyes weep. It is not between the walls, it is nowhere. It vanishes; a bent body with a bleeding face replaces it, walks slowly away, seems to stop at each step, never stops. There is a consciousness of this body walking slowly in a dark street. It walks but it gets no further away. The dark street does not end, it loses itself in nothingness. It is not between the walls, it is nowhere. And there is consciousness of a stifled voice which says: “The Self-Taught Man is wandering through the city.”Not the same city, not between these toneless walls, the Self-Taught Man walks in a city where he is not forgotten.”","The waitress does not move.

It isn’t an aim , it’s a means. It helps you to get rid of yourself; to contemplate and criticize yourself: that’s the attitude you prefer. When you look at yourself, you imagine you aren’t what you see, you imagine you are nothing. That is your ideal: you want to be nothing.’’3. ‘In vain he repeated the once inspiring phrase: ‘I must be free: I must be self-impelled, and able to say: ‘’I am because I will: I am my own beginning.’’ Empty, pompous words, the commonplaces of the intellectual.’4. ‘He had waited so long: his later years had been no more than a stand-to. Oppressed with countless daily cares, he had waited…But through all that, his sole care had been to hold himself in readiness. For an act. A free, considered act; that should pledge his whole life, and stand at the beginning of a new existence….He waited. And during all that time, gently, stealthily, the years had come, they had grasped him from behind….’5. ‘ ‘It was love. This time, it was love. And Mathiue thought:’ What have I done?’ Five minutes ago this love didn’t exist; there was between them a rare and precious feeling, without a name and not expressible in gestures.’6. ‘ The fact is, you are beyond my comprehension: you, so prompt with your indignation when you hear of an injustice, you keep this woman for years in a humiliating position, for the sole pleasure of telling yourself that you are respecting your principles. It wouldn’t be so bad if it were true, if you really did adapt your life to your ideas. But, I must tell you once more…you like that sort of life-placid, orderly, the typical life of an official.’‘’That freedom consisted in frankly confronting situations into which one had deliberately entered, and accepting all one’s responsibilities.’‘Well…perhaps I’m doing you an injustice. Perhaps you haven’t in fact reached the age of reason, it’s really a moral age…perhaps I’ve got there sooner than you have.’ 7. ‘ I have nothing to defend. I am not proud of my life and I’m penniless. My freedom? It’s a burden to me, for years past I have been free and to no purpose. I simply long to exchange it for a good sound of certainty….Besides, I agree with you that no one can be a man who has not discovered something for which he is prepared to die.’8. ‘‘I have led a toothless life’, he thought. ‘ A toothless life. I have never bitten into anything. I was waiting. I was reserving myself for later on-and I have just noticed that my teeth have gone. What’s to be done? Break the shell? That’s easily said. Besides, what would remain? A little viscous gum, oozing through the dust and leaving a glistering trail behind it.’9.’’ A life’, thought Mathieu, ‘is formed from the future just like the bodies are compounded from the void’. He bent his head: he thought of his own life. The future had made way into his heart, where everything was in process and suspense. The far-off days of childhood, the day when he has said:’I will be free’, the day when he had said: ’I will be famous’, appeared to him even now with their individual future, like a small, circled individual sky above them all, and the future was himself, himself just as he was at present, weary and a little over-ripe, they had claims upon him across the passage of time past, they maintained their insistencies, and he was often visited by attacks of devastating remorse, because his casual, cynical present was the original future of those past days.","But what a poor lie: no one has any rights; they are entirely free, like other men, they cannot succeed in not feeling superfluous.

Thoughts are the dullest things. Duller than flesh. They stretch out and there’s no end to them and they leave a funny taste in the mouth.

It goes, it goes . . . and there’s no end to it. It’s worse than the rest because I feel responsible and have complicity in it. For example, this sort of painful rumination: I exist, I am the one who keeps it up. I. The body lives by itself once it has begun. But thought—I am the one who continues it, unrolls it. I exist. How serpentine is this feeling of existing—I unwind it, slowly. . . . If I could keep myself from thinking! I try, and succeed: my head seems to fill with smoke . . . and then it starts again: “Smoke . . . not to think . . . don’t want to think . . . I think I don’t want to think. I mustn’t think that I don’t want to think. Because that’s still a thought.” Will there never be an end to it?My thought is me: that’s why I can’t stop. I exist because I think . . . and I can’t stop myself from thinking. At this very moment—it’s frightful—if I exist, it is because I am horrified at existing. I am the one who pulls myself from the nothingness to which I aspire: the hatred, the disgust of existing, there are as many ways to make myself exist, to thrust myself into existence. Thoughts are born at the back of me, like sudden giddiness, I feel them being born behind my head . . . if I yield, they’re going to come round in front of me, between my eyes—and I always yield, the thought grows and grows and there it is, immense, filling me completely and renewing my existence.”","...we are not on the side of history made.

Dalgakıranları, savunma duvarları, elektrik santralleri, izabe fırınları, şahmerdanları o zaman ne işlerine yarayacak? Her zaman gerçekleşebilir bu, hatta biraz sonra bile; işaretleri var zaten. Sözgelimi, gezmeye çıkmış bir aile babası, kırmızı renkli bir paçavranın, rüzgara kapılmış gibi sokağın öte yanından kendine doğru geldiğini görecek. Paçavra yanına geldiği zaman bunun, sürünüp duran, sıçrayan, toza bulanmış, kokmuş bir et parçası; kasılıp gevşedikçe kan fışkırtarak su akıntılarına yuvarlanıp giden işkenceye uğramış bir vücut parçası olduğunu görecek. Ya da bir anne, çocuğunun vücuduna bakarken, ''Ne olmuş yanağına, sivilce mi çıkıyor?'' diyecek ve etin biraz şişip yarılarak ortaya çıkan çatlağın dibinde bir üçüncü gözün, güleç bir gözün belirdiğini görecek. Ya da ırmakta yüzen birinin sazlara değdiği zaman duyduğu okşayışlara benzer okşayışlar kaplayacak gövdelerini. O zaman, elbiselerinin birer canlı haline geldiğini anlayacaklar. Bir başkası ağzını bir şeyin tırmaladığını duyacak; aynaya yaklaşıp bakınca dilinin, ayaklarını oynatıp damağını tırmalayan capcanlı, kocaman bir kırkayak haline girmiş olduğunu görecek. Tükürmek isteyecek onu, ama kırkayak gövdesinin bir parçası haline gelmiş olduğu için elleriyle çekip koparma zorunda kalacak. Yeni sözler kullanarak adlandırılması gereken yığın şey ortaya çıkacak; taş-göz, üç-köşeli-kocaman kol, ayak-parmağı-koltuk değneği, örümcek-çene. Sıcak yatağında uykuya varmış olan kimse, mavimsi bir toprak üstünde, Jouxtebovuille'in bacalarını hatırlatan, göğe doğru kırmızı ve bembeyaz yükselen, yarısı toprağa gömülü tüylü ve soğan gibi yuvarlak kocaman yumruları olan uğultulu bir erkek organları ormanında çırçıplak uyanacak. Ve kuşlar onların çevresinde uçuşacak; onları gagalayacak ve kanatacak. Yaralardan tohumlar akacak ağır ağır; küçük kabarcıklarla dolu ılık cam gibi saydam, kanla karışmış tohumlar. Ya da böyle bir şey olmayacak, göze görünür bir değişiklik çıkmayacak ortaya, ama insanlar bir sabah pencerelerini açınca, nesnelerin üzerine çökmüş olan ve bekler gibi duran bir çeşit korkunç anlamla şaşıracaklar. Yalnız bu olacak, ama kısa bir zaman sürse de insanlar yığın yığın intihara kalkışacaklar. Evet, böyle. Değişik olsun biraz, görelim; daha fazlasını istemiyorum.

A glorious little suffering has just been born, an exemplary suffering. Four notes on the saxophone. They come and go, they seem to say: You must be like us, suffer in rhythm. All right! Naturally, I’d like to suffer that way, in rhythm, without complacence, without self-pity, with an arid purity. But is it my fault if the beer at the bottom of my glass is warm, if there are brown stains on the mirror, if I am not wanted, if the sincerest of my sufferings drags and weighs, with too much flesh and the skin too wide at the same time, like a sea-elephant, with bulging eyes, damp and touching and yet so ugly? No, they certainly can’t tell me it’s compassionate—this little jewelled pain which spins around above the record and dazzles me. Not even ironic: it spins gaily, completely self-absorbed; like a scythe it has cut through the drab intimacy of the world and now it spins and all of us, Madeleine, the thick-set man, the patronne, myself, the tables, benches, the stained mirror, the glasses, all of us abandon ourselves to existence, because we were among ourselves, only among ourselves, it has taken us unawares, in the disorder, the day to day drift: I am ashamed for myself and for what exists in front of it.It does not exist. It is even an annoyance; if I were to get up and rip this record from the table which holds it, if I were to break it in two, I wouldn’t reach it. It is beyond—always beyond something, a voice, a violin note. Through layers and layers of existence, it veils itself, thin and firm, and when you want to seize it, you find only existants, you butt against existants devoid of sense. It is behind them: I don’t even hear it, I hear sounds, vibrations in the air which unveil it. It does not exist because it has nothing superfluous: it is all the rest which in relation to it is superfluous. It is.And I, too, wanted to be. That is all I wanted; this is the last word. At the bottom of all these attempts which seemed without bonds, I find the same desire again: to drive existence out of me, to rid the passing moments of their fat, to twist them, dry them, purify myself, harden myself, to give back at last the sharp, precise sound of a saxophone note. That could even make an apologue: there was a poor man who got in the wrong world. He existed, like other people, in a world of public parks, bistros, commercial cities and he wanted to persuade himself that he was living somewhere else, behind the canvas of paintings, with the doges of Tintoretto, with Gozzoli’s Florentines, behind the pages of books, with Fabrizio del Dongo and Julien Sorel, behind the phonograph records, with the long dry laments of jazz. And then, after making a complete fool of himself, he understood, he opened his eyes, he saw that it was a misdeal: he was in a bistro, just in front of a glass of warm beer. He stayed overwhelmed on the bench; he thought: I am a fool. And at that very moment, on the other side of existence, in this other world which you can see in the distance, but without ever approaching it, a little melody began to sing and dance: “You must be like me; you must suffer in rhythm.","En vérité, la prompte retraite de mon père m'avait gratifié d'un « Œdipe » fort incomplet: pas de Sur-moi, d'accord, mais point d'agressivité non plus.

They have seen the elegant dresses that appear to be new, the suits which, from afar, still seem fashionable; rarely have they encountered that paleness of face, that bodily decline that normally signifies starvation. Their solicitude, since it has been deceived, turns to rancor: I believe that they are dismayed not to find us conforming to the pathetic image they had formed of us in advance.","Someone must have scratched the record at that spot because it makes an odd noise. And there is something that clutches the heart: the melody is absolutely untouched by this tiny coughing of the needle on the record. It is so far—so far behind. I understand that too: the disc is scratched and is wearing out, perhaps the singer is dead; I’m going to leave, I’m going to take my train.

I cannot act upon it, change a single note of it, or slow down its movement. But it depends on the real for its appearance: that the conductor does not faint away, that a fire in the hall does not put an end to the performance. From this we cannot conclude that the seventh symphony has come to an end. No, we only think that the performance of the symphony has ceased. Does this not show clearly that the performance of the symphony is its analogue? It can manifest itself only through analogues which are dated and which unroll in our time. But to experience it on these analogues the imaginative reduction must be functioning, that is, the real sounds must be apprehended as analogues. It therefore occurs as a perpetual elsewhere, a perpetual absence. We must not picture it (as does spandrell in point counterpoint by huxley as so many platonisms) as existing in another world, in an intelligible heaven. It is not only outside time and space as are essences, for instance it is outside the real, outside existence. I do not hear it actually, i listen to it in the imaginary. Here we find the explanation for the considerable difficulty we always experience in passing from the world of the theatre or of music into that of our daily affairs. There is in fact no passing from one world into the other, but only a passing from the imaginative attitude to that of reality. Aesthetic contemplation is an induced dream and the passing into the real is an actual waking up.","Ben geçmişimi nerede saklayacağım? Geçmişinizi cebinizde saklayamazsınız.

Everywhere, on billboards, in the newspapers, on the screen, we encountered the revolting and insipid picture of ourselves that our suppressors wanted us to accept. And because of this we were free. Because the Nazi venom seeped into our thoughts, every accurate thought was a conquest. Because an all-powerful police tried to force us to hold our tongues, every word took on the value of a declaration of principles. Because we were hunted down, every one of our gestures had the weight of a solemn commitment...

But before going further, we must avoid a misunderstanding: don’t think that it was overwhelming. As I have already said, we lived. What I mean is, we worked, ate, conversed, slept and at times even laughed – even if the laughter was rare. The horror appeared to be outside us, inherent in things. We could distract ourselves for moments at a time, becoming involved in a lecture, a conversation, a love affair; but we’d always return to ourselves and realize that it had not left us.","Eres un mocoso a quien le cuesta pasar a la edad adulta, pero serás un hombre muy aceptable si alguien te facilita el paso.","Ama biz, yarının henüz orada olmadığını hep unutuyoruz.","Исках миговете от живота ми да се следват и подреждат като мигове от живот, който си спомняш.

In each one of these privileged situations there are certain acts which have to be done, certain attitudes to be taken, words which must be said—and other attitudes, other words are strictly prohibited. Is that it?”“I suppose so. . . .”“In fact, then, the situation is the material: it demands exploitation.”“That’s it,” she says. “First you had to be plunged into something exceptional and feel as though you were putting it in order. If all those conditions had been realized, the moment would have been perfect.”“In fact, it was a sort of work of art.”“You’ve already said that,” she says with irritation. “No: it was . . . a duty.

They’d approach the window, enticed, only to read on a placard: artificial display. So it was with Paris: it was nothing more than an artificial display. Everything was hollow and empty: the Louvre without paintings, the Chamber without deputies, the Senate without senators, the Lycée Montaigne without students. The artificial existence that the Germans maintained, the theatrical events, the races, the miserable and lugubrious festivals held only in order to show the universe that France was saved because Paris still lived: all were the strange consequence of centralization.","[C]es émotions inoffensives je ne les ai jamais refusées; au contraire.

But the Resistance was nothing more than an individual solution, and we always knew that; even without it, the English would have won the war, with it they would still have lost if they were going to lose. It had, however, in our eyes, a symbolic valor; and that is why so many resisters had a desperate air about them: always symbols.

There had been nothing before it. Nothing. There had been no moment at which it might not have existed. It was that which irritated me; naturally there was no reason for it to exist...But it was not possible for it not to exist. That was unthinkable: in order to imagine nothingness, you had to be there already, right in the world, with your eyes wide open and alive; nothingness was just an idea in my head, an existing idea floating in that immensity; this nothingness hadn't come before existence, it was an existence like any other and one which had appeared after a great many others.","Era più varia la mattina.

Mas através de tudo isso a sua única preocupação fora manter-se disponível. Para uma acção. Um acto. Um acto livre e reflectido que acarretaria o destino da sua vida e seria o início de uma nova existência. Nunca pudera prender-se definitivamente a um amor, a um prazer, nunca fora realmennte infeliz; sempre lhe parecera estar algures, não ter ainda nascido completamente. Esperava.

But I wanted to fix the absolute character of this absurdity here.

From time to time you make a semi-total: you say: I’ve been travelling for three years, I’ve been in Bouville for three years. Neither is there any end: you never leave a woman, a friend, a city in one go. And then everything looks alike: Shanghai, Moscow, Algiers, everything is the same after two weeks. There are moments—rarely—when you make a landmark, you realize that you’re going with a woman, in some messy business. The time of a flash. After that, the procession starts again, you begin to add up hours and days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. April, May, June. 1924, 1925, 1926.That’s living. But everything changes when you tell about life; it’s a change no one notices: the proof is that people talk about true stories.

This sentence, taken simply for what it is, means that the man was absorbed, morose, a hundred leagues from an adventure, exactly in the mood to let things happen without noticing them. But the end is there, transforming everything. For us, the man is already the hero of the story. His moroseness, his money troubles are much more precious than ours, they are all gilded by the light of future passions. And the story goes on in the reverse: instants have stopped piling themselves in a lighthearted way one on top of the other, they are snapped up by the end of the story which draws them and each one of them in turn, draws out the preceding instant: “It was night, the street was deserted.” The phrase is cast out negligently, it seems superfluous; but we do not let ourselves be caught and we put it aside: this is a piece of information whose value we shall subsequently appreciate. And we feel that the hero has lived all the details of this night like annunciations, promises, or even that he lived only those that were promises, blind and deaf to all that did not herald adventure. We forget that the future was not yet there; the man was walking in a night without forethought, a night which offered him a choice of dull rich prizes, and he did not make his choice.I wanted the moments of my life to follow and order themselves like those of a life remembered.

Никаких воспоминаний: беспощадная, палящая любовь – ни тени, ни уголка, где укрыться, куда отступить. Три года, спрессованные воедино, составляли наше сегодня. Потому-то мы и расстались: у нас не хватило сил выносить дальше такое бремя. А потом, когда Анни сразу, без раздумий, бросила меня, три года рухнули в прошлое. Я даже не страдал, я был опустошен. Потом время потекло дальше, и пустота стала разрастаться. Потом в Сайгоне, когда я решил вернуться во Францию, все, что еще сохранялось от прошлого – чужеземные лица, площади, набережные длинных рек, – все кануло в небытие.

Simţeam că mă umflu de eroism, îmi dădeam frîu liber, îmi plăcea. După care, a doua zi, eram la fel de scîrbit ca şi cînd m-aş fi trezit într-un pat plin de vărsături. Nu vomit cînd mă îmbăt, dar poate ar fi mai bine s-o fac. Ieri n-aveam nici măcar scuza beţiei. M-am exaltat ca un imbecil. Am nevoie să mă curăţ cu gînduri abstracte, transparente ca apa.","Solo los actos deciden acerca de lo que se ha querido.","Ma liberté s'arrête ou commence celle d'autrui.","Ich möchte Ihnen so viel sagen, aber ich bin ausgeleert, sobald ich zu sprechen anfange. Alles ist wie weggeblasen. Sehen Sie: ich finde Sie schön, zum Beispiel; aber ich kann mich nicht wirklich darüber freuen. Es ist, als ob mir etwas fehlte ...\" (S. 64).","It is a profound boredom, profound, the profound heart of existence, the very matter I am made of.","Things are entirely what they appear to be and BEHIND THEM... there is nothing.","No eres nada más que tu vida.","...here we are, all of us, eating and drinking to preserve our precious existence, and that there's nothing, nothing, absolutely no reason for existing.","He seems to be a real enough character, and even tells us that he is thirty years old. Yet whenever Roquentin talks about his past, it has the studied randomness and the glamorous opacity of espionage. He is a spy from the world of nothingness. For instance, he talks carelessly about having been in an unlikely number of places: Shanghai, Moscow, Algiers, Meknes, Saigon, Aden, Hanoi, Angkor.","...jag vet på förhand att dagen är tillspillogiven. Jag kommer inte att göra någonting bra förrän kanske natten faller på. Det beror på solen; den kastar ett svagt guldskimmer över den smutsvita rök som hänger i luften över järnvägen, den silar in i mitt rum, blond och blek och ritar på bordet fyra matta, falska reflexer.","Оттого что мысли мои не облекаються в слова, чаще всего они остаються хлопьями тумана. Они принимают смутные, причудливые формы, набегают одна на другую, и я тотчас их забываю.","Shall I awake in a few months, a few years, exhausted, disappointed, in the midst of fresh ruins? I should like to understand myself properly before it is too late.","Something begins in order to end: an adventure doesn’t let itself be extended; it achieves significance only through its death. Towards this death, which may also be my own, I am drawn irrevocably. Each moment appears only to bring on the moments after. To each moment I cling with all my heart: I know that it is unique, irreplaceable – and yet I would not lift a finger to prevent it from being annihilated.","I am alone now. Not quite alone. Hovering in front of me is still this idea. It has rolled itself into a ball, it stays there like a large cat; it explains nothing, it does not move, and it contents itself with saying no.","I was neither a grandfather, nor a father, nor even a husband. I didn’t vote, I scarcely paid any taxes; I couldn’t lay claim to the rights of a tax-payer, nor to those of an elector, nor even to the humble right to honour which twenty years of obedience confer on an employee. My existence was beginning to cause me serious concern. Was I a mere figment of the imagination?","...an existent can never justify the existence of another existent.","أخيرًا، ثمة سؤال واحد أود طرحه – فقط سؤال واحد: هل لدينا الآن من الوسائل ما يمكننا من وضع أسس أَنْثرُبُولُوجيا تاريخية؟ لتلك الأنثربولوجيا أن تجد مكانها بين طيات الفلسفة الماركسية، لأنني – كما سيتضح لاحقًا – أعتبر الماركسية فلسفة عصرنا التي لا نقدر على تجاوزها، ولأنني أحمل أيديولوجيا الوجودية ومنهجها الشامل لتصبح مُكتَنَفة داخل الماركسية التي تجمع في وقت واحد بين استدعائها ورفضها.منحت الماركسية الوجودية ميلادًا جديدًا، وورثت الأخيرة منها حتميتين – كانت الماركسية قد اشتقتهما من الهيجلية: إن كان ثمة حقيقة في الأنثربولوجيا، فيتعين أن تكون قد تحققت، وعلى هيئة تعميم. من البديهي أن المتطلب المزدوج ذاك يعرِّف تلك الحركة من الوجود والمعرفة (الجامعة لهما) التي أسماها هيجل \"الديالكتيك\".","La libertad es lo q haces con lo q está hecho para ti","По-моему, понятие \"приключение\" можно определить так: событие, которое выходит за рамки привычного, хотя не обязательно должно быть необычным.Истинное начало [приключения] возникает как звук трубы, как первые ноты джазовой мелодии, оно разом проганяет скуку, уплотняет время. Это крохотное событие не похоже на другие - ты сразу чувствуешь, оно предваряет что-то значительное, чьи очертания еще теряются во мгле, и ты говоришь себе: \"Что-то начинается\".Что-то начинается, чтобы прийти к концу: приключение не терпит длительности; его смысл в его гибели.","Will I gain anything by the change? It is still a city: this one happens to be cut in two by a river, the other one is by the sea, yet they look alike. One takes a piece of bare sterile earth and one rolls big hollow stones on to it. Odours are held captive in these stones, odours heavier than air. Sometimes people throw them out of the windows into the streets and they stay there until the wind breaks them apart. In clear weather, noises come in one end of the city and go out the other, after going through all the walls; at other times, the noises whirl around inside these sun-baked, ice-split stones.","Nausea’s very subject is the randomness, the contingency, the superfluity, of the world; where better to begin than with Roquentin’s own randomness, his contingency as an invented character?","In the second place, this is the only theory that endows man with any dignity, and the only one that does not turn him into an object.","Felicidad no es hacer lo que uno quiere sino querer lo que uno hace.","The effect of any form of materialism is to treat all men—including oneself—as objects, which is to say as a set of predetermined reactions indistinguishable from the properties and phenomena that constitute, say, a table, a chair, or a stone. Our aim is exactly to establish the human kingdom as a set of values distinct from the material world.","it is not only oneself that one discovers in the cogito, but also the existence of others.","Seuls les actes décident de ce qu’on a voulu.","Чувство приключения - это, пожалуй, попросту и есть чувство необратимости времени. Только почему оно присуще нам не всегда? Может, время не всегда необатимо?Бывают минуты, когда кажется, что ты можешь делать что хочешь: забежать вперед, возвратиться вспять - значения не имеет, а в другие моменты петли стягиваются, и вот эти минуты упускать нельзя, потому что начать сначала невозможно.","A stranger to the needs, hopes, and pleasures of the species, I squandered myself coldly in order to charm it. It was my audience; I was separated, from it by footlights that forced me into a proud exile which quickly turned to anguish.","Biz gümbürtüye gitmiş insanlarız,\" diyordu gururla, \"biz hayatı ıskalayanlardanız. Hiçbir işe yaramayacağız.","C'est la nuit, qui abolit tout, fatigues et passions. Les opprimés dorment, les révoltés aussi; le monde est enseveli, l'histoire reprend haleine. Il reste, dans une bulle de lumière entourée de néant, cette élite qui veille, tout occupée de ses cérémonies.","Étranger à moi-même, je sais. Hors nature, contre nature, sans excuse, sans autre recours qu'en moi. Mais je ne reviendrai pas sous ta loi: je suis condamné à n'avoir d'autre loi que la mienne. Je ne reviendrai pas à ta nature: mille chemins y sont tracés qui conduisent vers toi, mais je ne peux suivre que mon chemin. Car je suis un homme, Jupiter, et chaque homme doit inventer son chemin. La nature a horreur de l'homme, et toi, toi, souverain des Dieux, toi aussi tu as les hommes en horreur.","Tri sata. Tri sata, to je vrijeme kad je uvijek prekasno ili prerano za sve ono sto covjek kani uciniti. Cudan popodnevni trenutak. Danas je upravo nepodnosljiv\"\"Ne slusam ih vise - idu mi na zivce. Ovo ce dvoje zavrsiti u krevetu. I oni to znaju. Svako od njih zna da i ono drugo zna. Ali, kako su mladi, cedni i pristojni, kako svako od njih zeli cuvati svoju cast i cast onoga drugoga, kako je ljubav velicanstvena poetska stvar koju ne valja poplasiti, oni odlaze viseput tjedno na ples i u restorane da pred svijetom izvode svoju predstavu, sa svojim malim obrednim i mehanickim plesovima...Na kraju krajeva, treba nekako utuci vrijeme. Mladi su i dobro gradjeni, imaju jos snage za tridesetak godina. Stoga im se ne zuri, sve nesto odgadjaju i imaju pravo. Kad jednom odspavaju zajedno, morat ce naci nesto drugo da prikriju golemi apsurd svoje egzistencije. Pa ipak...je li bas prijeko potrebno da lazu sami sebi?\"\"Oduvijek su vidjeli samo ukrocenu vodu sto curi iz slavine, samo svjetlo sto izvire iz zarulje na prekidac, samo krizano, bastardno drvece poduprto rasljastim podupiracima. Sto puta na dan dobivaju dokaze da se sve radi mehanicki, da se svijet pokorava fiksnim i nepromjenjivim zakonima. Tijela pustena u prazninu padaju sva istom brzinom, javni park zatvara svakog dana u sesnaest sati,a ljeti u osamnaest, olovo se tali na 335 stupnjeva Celzijevih, posljednji tramvaj polazi od Gradske vjecnice u dvadeset tri sata i pet minuta. Oni su mirni, pomalo mrzovoljni, misle na sutrasnjicu, sto ce jednostavno reci na novu danasnjicu; u gradovima je uvijek jedan te isti dan koji se svakog jutra potpuno jednak vraca. Samo ga nedjeljom malo iskite, Idioti!","Now I think of no one any more. I don’t even bother looking for words. It flows in me, more or less quickly. I fix nothing, I let it go. Through the lack of attaching myself to words, my thoughts remain nebulous most of the time. They sketch vague, pleasant shapes and then are swallowed up: I forget them almost immediately.","A writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution. This attitude is based on my conception of the writer’s enterprise. A writer who adopts political, social or literary positions must act only within the means that are his own – that is, the written word.","Roquentin is visited by a deeper, more philosophical ailment: he falls into bouts of what he calls his “Nausea. These are episodes in which, afflicted by his sense that there is “absolutely no more reason for living,”","Le secret douloureux des Dieux et des rois : c'est que les hommes sont libres. Ils sont libres, Égisthe. Tu le sais, et ils ne le savent pas.","هر کس که عزم کرده باشد تا بعضی مطالب را بگوید نویسنده نیست، نویسنده آن کس است که طریقی برگزیند تا آنها را به شیوه ای خاص بگوید. و ارزش نثر البته بسته به سبک است. اما سبک باید ناپیدا باشد","Cuando se hayan acostado juntos, habrá que buscar otra cosa para ocultar el enorme absurdo de la existencia. Con todo ..., ¿es absolutamente necesario engañarse?","Construyo mis recuerdos con el presente. Estoy desechado, abandonado en el presente. En vano trato de alcanzar el pasado; no puedo escaparme.","You know, it’s quite an undertaking to start loving somebody. You have to have energy, generosity, blindness …. There is even a moment, right at the start, where you have to jump across an abyss: if you think about it you don’t do it.","A man is involved in life, leaves his impress on it, and outside of that there is nothing. To be sure, this may seem a harsh thought to someone whose life hasn't been a success. But, on the other hand, it prompts people to understand that reality alone is what counts, that dreams, expectations, and hopes warrant no more than to define a man as a disappointed dream, as miscarried hopes, as vain expectations. In other words, to define him negatively and not positively.","qui suis-je, sinon la peur que les autres ont de moi ?","Birazdan yatacaklar. Biliyorlar bunu. Her biri bunu, ötekinin bildiğini de biliyor. Ama genç, temiz ve kibar oldukları, her biri kendisine ve karşısındakine duyduğu saygıyı sürdürmek istediği ve aşk ürkütülmemesi gereken şiirsel bir şey olduğu için, haftada birkaç kere balolara ya da lokantalara gidip o küçük törensel ve mekanik danslarını gösteriyorlar.Zaman öldürmek gerekiyor zaten. İkisi de genç ve sıhhatli, daha otuz yılları var. Yattıkları zaman, hayatlarının sınırsız saçmalığını kapamak için başka bir şey bulmaları gerekecek. Peki... Kendi kendini aldatmak gerçekten kaçınılmaz bir şey mi?","La justice est une affaire d'hommes,","Siempre muere uno demasiado pronto...o demasiado tarde.","Aquel que quiere ser amado, debe querer la libertad del otro, porque de ella emerge el amor, si lo someto, se vuelve objeto, y de un objeto no puedo recibir amor","Pas facile, pour le philosophe, de dialoguer si l'interlocuteur met en cause sa doctrine tout en refusant de parler philosophie!","Мягкий свет; люди сидят по домам, они, конечно, тоже зажгли лампы. Они читают или смотрят в окно на небо. Для них… для них все иначе. Они состарились по-другому. Они живут среди завещанного добра, среди подарков, и каждый предмет их обстановки – воспоминание. Каминные часы, медали, портреты, ракушки, пресс-папье, ширмы, шали. Их шкафы битком набиты бутылками, отрезами, старой одеждой, газетами – они сохранили все. Прошлое – это роскошь собственника.А где бы я стал хранить свое прошлое? Прошлое в карман не положишь, надо иметь дом, где его разместить. У меня есть только мое тело, одинокий человек со своим одиноким телом не может удержать воспоминания, они проходят сквозь него. Я не имею права жаловаться: я хотел одного – быть свободным.","Mizantropul este om: e absolut necesar ca umanistul sa fie intr-o oarecare masura mizantrop.Dar e un mizantrop stiintific, care a stiut sa-si dozeze ura, care incepe prin a-i uri pe oameni pentru a-i putea iubi mai bine, apoi.","Un roi doit avoir les mêmes souvenirs que ses sujets.","At one point, Roquentin realizes that the seat he is on is a seat only by name: “it could just as well be a dead donkey. . . . Things are divorced from their names. They are there, grotesque, headstrong, gigantic, and it seems ridiculous to call them seats or say anything at all about them: I am in the midst of things, nameless things.","Le teníamos un miedo horrible porque sabíamos que estaba solo.","Every anti-communist is a dog.","L'angoisse commence pour un homme et le délaissement et les sueurs de sang, quand il ne peut plus avoir d'autre témoin que lui-même.","Cada día te pareces un poco más al cadáver que serás y yo te amo siempre.","Talvez o senhor escreva para a posteridade. Mas queira ou não queira, para alguém escreve.Mas é uma cilada: se consinto, o Autodidacta triunfa e sou imediatamente contornado, reivindicado, ultrapassado, porque o humanismo toma à sua conta e funda na mesma massa todas as atitudes humanas. Que agradável que é às vezes poder conversar assim, ao abandono. Deitei um olhar à minha volta: móveis leves e soltos, e eu próprio. Era o que existia. O passado não existia. Nem as coisas, nem sequer no meu pensamento. Havia muito tempo que eu tinha compreendido que o meu me tinha escapado. Mas julgava, até então, que se tinha retirado do meu alcance. Para mim o passado era apenas entrada na reforma: era outra maneira de existir, um estado de férias e de inacção, cada acontecimento quando findara o seu papel se arrumava atinadamente, por si próprio, numa caixa e se tornava acontecimento honorário: tal é a dificuldade que se tem em imaginar o nada. Agora compreendia: a coisas são inteiramente o que parecem, e por trás delas...não há nada.Quando uma pessoa quer compreender uma coisa coloca-se diante dela, sem auxílio. De nada serviria todo o passado do mundo.Acho que não temos de ir buscar tão longe o sentido da vida","وقتی خدا ساکت است، می‌توان هر ادعائی را به او نسبت داد.","Nothing new. I admire the way we can lie, putting reason on our side. Evidently, nothing new has happened, if you care to put it that way: this morning at eight-fifteen, just as I was leaving the Hotel Printania to go to the library, I wanted to and could not pick up a paper lying on the ground. This is all and it is not even an event. Yes—but, to tell the whole truth, I was deeply impressed by it: I felt I was no longer free.”","Mighty king, come from so far, prepared by so many combinations, by so many vanished gestures. He disappears in turn, so that other combinations can be born, other gestures, attacks, counterattacks, turns of luck, a crowd of small adventures.","Невъзможно ми е да виждам нещата по такъв начин. Разплутост, отмала — това да. Дърветата блуждаеха. Устрем към небето ли? По-скоро грохване; всеки миг очаквах да съгледам как стволовете се спихват като спукани балони, как се сгърчват и свличат на земята в черна, мека, надиплена купчинка. Те нямаха желание да съществуват, само че не можеха да се възпрат — ето каква беше работата. И тъй, те действаха в жалките си готварници кротко, без жар; мъзгата се изкачваше по жилките бавно, неохотно и коренищата бавно се вбиваха в земята. Но изглеждаха готови тутакси да зарежат всичко и да изчезнат. Безсилни и стари, те продължаваха да съществуват по принуда само защото бяха твърде немощни, за да умрат, защото смъртта можеше да дойде само отвън; единствено мелодиите гордо носят своята гибел в себе си, като вътрешна необходимост — те обаче не съществуват. Всяко съществуване възниква без причина, запазва се от безволие и замира по случайност. Отпуснах се назад и затворих клепачи. Ала образите тутакси се пробудиха, надигнаха се и наляха със съществувания склопените ми очи: съществуването е пълнота, от която човек не може да избяга.","Mein augenblickliches Leben ist nicht besonders glanzvoll, [...]"]
