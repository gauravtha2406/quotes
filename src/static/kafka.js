    "Don Quixote's misfortune is not his imagination, but Sancho Panza.",
    "What I write is different from what I say, what I say is different from what I think, what I think is different from what I ought to think and so it goes further into the deepest darkness.",
    "This inescapable duty to observe oneself: if someone else is observing me, naturally I have to observe myself too; if none observe me, I have to observe myself all the closer.",
    "If education tries to make other persons out of us than we essentially are, deeper inside, it stultifies, and reproach matters.",
    "There are two cardinal human sins out of which all others derive, deviate, and dissipate: impatience and lassitude (or perhaps nonchalance). On account of impatience they are driven out of paradise; on account of lassitude or nonchalance they do not return. Perhaps, however, only one main sense of sin is given: impatience. On account of impatience they are driven out, on account of impatience they do not turn back.",
    "Idleness is the beginning of all vice, the crown of all virtues.",
    "I made the remark that I don't avoid people in order to live quietly, but rather in order to be able to die quietly.",
    "I can prove at any time that my education tried to make another person out of me than the one I became. It is for the harm, therefore, that my educators could have done me in accordance with their intentions that I reproach them; I demand from their hands the person I now am, and since they cannot give him to me, I make of my reproach and laughter a drumbeat sounding in the world beyond.",
    "Now I can look at you in peace; I don't eat you any more.",
    "In Paradise, as always: that which causes the sin and that which recognizes it for what it is are one. The clear conscience is Evil, which is so entirely victorious that it does not any longer consider the leap from left to right necessary.",

    "German is my mother tongue and as such more natural to me, but I consider Czech much more affectionate, which is why your letter removes several uncertainties; I see you more clearly, the movements of your body, your hands, so quick, so resolute, itâ€™s almost like a meeting.",
    "One of the first signs of the beginning of understanding is the wish to die. This life appears unbearable, another unattainable. One is no longer ashamed of wanting to die; one asks to be moved from the old cell, which one hates, to a new one, which one willl only in time come to hate. In this there is also a residue of belief that during the move the master will chance to come along the corridor, look at the prisoner and say: \"This man is not to be locked up again, He is to come with me.",

    "My job is unbearable to me because it conflicts with my only desire and my only calling, which is literature. Since I am nothing but literature and can and want to be nothing else, my job will never take possession of me, it may, however, shatter me completely, and this is by no means a remote possibility.",

    "A man of action forced into a state of thought is unhappy until he can get out of it.",
    "This perversion of the truth, familiar to the artist though it was, always unnerved him afresh and proved too much for him.

To fight against this lack of understanding, against a whole world of nonunderstanding, was impossible.",

    "One has just been sent out as a biblical dove, has found nothing green, and slips back into the darkness of the Ark",

    "Always first draw fresh breath after outbursts of vanity and complacency.",
    "and in that recurring dream, I found myself trapped in some sort of gigantic game of which I was unfamiliar with the rules; lost in a labyrinthine town of dark and damp, criss-crossing streets, ambiguous characters of uncertain authority having no idea of why I was there nor what I had to do, and where the first sign of the beginning of understanding was the wish to die.",
    "Knowledge we have. Anyone who strives for it with particular intensity is suspect of striving against it.",
    "Human judgment of human actions is true and void , that is to say, first true and then void.... The judgment of the word is true, the judgment in itself is void.... Only he who is a party can really judge, but as a party he cannot judge. Hence it follows that there is no possibility of judgment in the world, only a glimmer of it.",
    "Maybe innocence makes its way easiest through the elemental chaos of this world.",

    "The Diabolical sometimes assumes the aspect of the Good, or even embodies itself completely in its form. If this remains concealedfrom me, I am of course defeated, for this Good is more tempting than the genuine Good.",
    "Hiding places there are innumerable, escape is only one, but possibilities of escape, again, are as many as hiding places.",
    "It is comforting to reflect that the disproportion of things in the world seems to be only arithmetical.",
    "If the book we are reading does not wake us, as with a fist hammering on our skull, why then do we read? So that it shall make us happy? Good God, we should also be happy if we had no books, and such books as make us happy we could, if need be, write ourselves. But what we must have are those books which come upon us like ill fortune, and distress us deeply, like the death of one we love better than ourselves; like suicide. A book must be an ice-axe to break the sea frozen inside us.",
    "Humility provides everyone, even him who despairs in solitude, with the strongest relationship to his fellow man.",
    "A picture of my existence... would show a useless wooden stake covered in snow... stuck loosely at a slant in the ground in a ploughed field on the edge of a vast open plain on a dark winter night.",
    "The old incapacity. Interrupted my writing for barely ten days and already cast out. Once again prodigious efforts stand before me. You have to dive down, as it were, and sink more rapidly than that which sinks in advance of you.",
    "Alas,\" said the mouse, \"the whole world is growing smaller every day. At the beginning it was so big that I was afraid, I kept running and running, and I was glad when I saw walls far away to the right and left, but these long walls have narrowed so quickly that I am in the last chamber already, and there in the corner stands the trap that I must run into.\" \"You only need to change your direction,\" said the cat, and ate it up.",

    "There is a goal but no way; what we call the way is mere wavering.",
    "The fact that there is nothing but a spiritual world deprives us of hope and gives us certainty.",
    "And I leave my post of observation and find I have had enough of this outside life; I feel that there is nothing more that I can learn here, either now or at any time. And I long to say a last goodbye to everything up here, to go down into my burrow never to return again, let things take their course, and not try to retard them with my profitless vigils.",

    "But Gregor understood easily that it was not only consideration for him which prevented their moving, for he could easily have been transported in a suitable crate with a few air holes; what mainly prevented the family from moving was their complete hopelessness and the thought that they had been struck by a misfortune as none of their relatives and acquaintances had ever been hit.",
    "For we are like tree trunks in the snow. In appearance they lie smoothly and a little push should be enough to set them rolling. No, it can't be done, for they are firmly wedded to the ground. But see, even that is only appearance.",
    "People who walk across dark bridges, past saints, with dim, small lights. Clouds which move across gray skies past churches with towers darkened in the dusk. One who leans against granite railing gazing into the evening waters, His hands resting on old stones.",
    "If something good has lost its way into you, it will make its escape overnight. I know you.",
    "People keep themselves at a tolerable height above an infernal abyss toward which they gravitate only by putting out all their strength and lovingly helping one another. They are tied together by ropes, and it's bad enough when the ropes around an individual loosen and he drops somewhat lower than the others into empty space; ghastly when the ropes break and he falls. That's why we should cling to the others.",
    "If all responsibility is imposed on you, then you may want to exploit the moment and want to be overwhelmed by the responsibility;yet if you try, you will notice that nothing was imposed on you, but that you are yourself this responsibility.",
    "there is nothing bad to fear; once you have crossed that threshold, all is well. Another world, and you do not have to speak",

    "A book should serve as an axe to the ice inside us.",
    "Evil is the radiation of the human consciousness in certain transitional positions. It is not actually the sensual world that is amere appearance; what is so is the evil of it, which, admittedly, is what constitutes the sensual world in our eyes.",

    "My life was sweeter than other people's and my death will be more terrible by the same degree.",
    "Why do we complain about the Fall? It is not on its account that we were expelled from Paradise, but on account of the Tree of Life, lest we might eat of it.",
    "All science is methodolgy with regard to the Absolute. Therefore, there need be no fear of the unequivocally methodological. It isa husk, but not more than everything except the One.",
    "At that point I asked myself: How is it that she is not amazed at herself, that she keeps her lips closed and makes no such remark?",
    "You, who can't do anything, think you can bring off something like that? How can you even dare to think about it? If you were capable of it, you certainly wouldn't be in need of it.",

    "A belief is like a guillotine, just as heavy, just as light.",

    "There can be knowledge of the diabolical, but no belief in it, for more of the diabolical than there is does not exist.",
    "Writer speaks a stench.",
    "Our art is a way of being dazzled by truth: the light on the grotesquely grimacing retreating face is true, and nothing else.",

    "The ulterior motives with which you absorb and assimilate Evil are not your own but those of Evil.",

    "Work as joy, inaccessible to the psychologists.",

    "When K. looked at the castle, often it seemed to him as if he were observing someone who sat quietly there in front of him gazing, not lost in thought and so oblivious of everything, but free and untroubled, as if he were alone with nobody to observe him, and yet must notice that he was observed, and all the same remained with his calm not even slightly disturbed; and really - one did not know whether it was cause or effect - the gaze of the observer could not remain concentrated there, but slid away.",
    "I don't know who the great lawyers are, and I presume you can't get to them. I know of no case where it can be said for certain that they took part. They defend some people, but you can't get them to do that through your own efforts, they only defend the ones they want to defend. But I assume a case they take on must have progressed beyond the lower court. It's better not to think of them at all, otherwise you'll find the consultations with the other lawyers, their advice and their assistance, extremely disgusting and useless.",
    "If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall right off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing.",
    "What a fate: to be condemned to work for a firm where the slightest negligence at once gave rise to the gravest suspicion! Were all the employees nothing but a bunch of scoundrels, was there not among them one single loyal devoted man who, had he wasted only an hour or so of the firm's time in the morning, was so tormented by conscience as to be driven out of his mind and actually incapable of leaving his bed?",

    "The ulterior motives with which you absorb and assimilate Evil are not your own but those of Evil. \n The animal wrests the whip from its master and whips itself in order to become master, not knowing that this is only a fantasy produced by a new knot in the master's whiplash.",

    "But questions that donâ€™t answer themselves at the very moment of their asking are never answered.",
    "Nervous states of the worst sort control me without pause. Everything that is not literature bores me and I hate it. I lack all aptitude for family life except, at best, as an observer. I have no family feeling and visitors make me almost feel as though I were maliciously being attacked.",

    "There will be no proof that I ever was a writer.",
    "I stand on the end platform of the tram and am completely unsure of my footing in this world, in this town, in my family. Not even casually could I indicate any claims that I might rightly advance in any direction. I have not even any defense to offer for standing on this platform, holding on to this strap, letting myself be carried along by this tram, nor for the people who give way to the tram or walk quietly along or stand gazing into shop windows. Nobody asks me to put up a defense, indeed, but that is irrelevant.",

    "In a way, I was safe writing",
    "The observer of the soul cannot penetrate into the soul, but there doubtless is a margin where he comes into contact with it. Recognition of this contact is the fact that even the soul does not know of itself. Hence it must remain unknown. That would be sad only if there were anything apart from the soul, but there is nothing else.",

    "it was like this. the brain could no longer bear the worries and pains that were imposed on it. it said: \"i'm giving up; but if there is anyone else here who is interested in preserving the whole, let him assume part of my burden and it will be alright for a bit.",
    "Palestine needs earth, but it does not need lawyers.",

    "It would be very unjust to say that you deserted me, but that I was deserted, and sometimes terribly so, is true.",
    "And so gentlemen, I learned. Oh, if you have to learn, you learn; if youâ€™re desperate for a way out, you learn; you learn pitilessly. You stand over yourself with a whip in your hand; if thereâ€™s the least resistance, you lash yourself.",

    "What is meant by its nature for the highest and the best, spreads among the lowly people.",

    "It receives you when you come and dismisses you when you go.",
    "The more horses you yoke the quicker everything will go - not the rending of the block from its foundation, which is impossible, but the snapping of the traces and with that the gay and empty journey.",
    "If they were shocked, then Gregor had no further responsibility and could be calm. But if they took everything calmly, he he, too, had no reason to get excited and could, if he hurried, actually be at the station by eight o'clock.",
    "It requires enormous presence of mind or rather quickness of wit, when opening your eyes to seize hold as it were of everything in the room at exactly the same place where you had let it go on the previous evening. That is why the moment of waking up was the riskiest moment of the day. Once that was well over without deflecting you from your orbit, you could take heart of grace for the rest of the day.",

    "Suffering is the positive element in this world, indeed it is the only link between this world and the positive.",

    "From a real antagonist one gains boundless courage.",
    "Writing sustains me. But wouldnâ€™t it be better to say it sustains this kind of life? Which doesn't mean life is any better when I donâ€™t write. On the contrary, it is far worse, wholly unbearable, and inevitably ends in madness. This is, of course, only on the assumption that I am a writer even when I donâ€™t write - which is indeed the case; and a non-writing writer is, in fact, a monster courting insanity.",
    "Towards the avoidance of a piece of verbal confusion: What is intended to be actively destroyed must first of all have been firmly grasped; what crumbles away crumbles away, but cannot be destroyed.",

The ulterior motives with which youabsorb and assimilate Evil are not your own but those of Evil.... Evil is whatever distracts. Evil knows of the Good, but Good does not know of Evil.

In the first case one cheats the Good, by trying to make it too easy for oneself to get it, and the Evil by imposing all too unfavorable conditions of warfare on it. In the second case one cheats the Good by keeping as aloof from it as possible, and the Evil by hoping to make it powerless through intensifying it to the utmost.",
    "The limited circle is pure.",

    "In a certain sense you deny the existence of this world. You explain life as a state of rest, a state of rest in motion.",
    "Expulsion from Paradise is in its main aspect eternal: that is to say, although expulsion from Paradise is final, and life in theworld unavoidable, the eternity of the process (or, expressed in temporal terms, the eternal repetition of the process) nevertheless makes it possible not only that we might remain in Paradise permanently, but that we may in fact be there permanently, no matter whether we know it here or not.",

    "A stair not worn hollow by footsteps is, regarded from its own point of view, only a boring something made of wood.",

    "Association with human beings lures one into self-observation.",
