    "Lying is not only saying what isn't true. It is also, in fact especially, saying more than is true and, in the case of the human heart, saying more than one feels. We all do it, every day, to make life simpler.",
    "The aim of art, the aim of a life can only be to increase the sum of freedom and responsibility to be found in every man and in the world. It cannot, under any circumstances, be to reduce or suppress that freedom, even temporarily.",
    "There is nothing abstract about pain. It is specific, it is real, and, when it is intense, it is world destroying.",
    "To know oneself, one should assert oneself.",
    "Love cannot accept what it is. Everywhere on earth it cries out against kindness, compassion, intelligence, everything that leads to compromise. Love demands the impossible, the absolute, the sky on fire, inexhaustible springtime, life after death, and death itself transfigured into eternal life.",
    "To feel absolutely right is the beginning of the end.",
    "A man devoid of hope and conscious of being so has ceased to belong to the future.",
    "In order to understand the world, one has to turn away from it on occasion.",
    "It is a well-known fact that we always recognize our homeland at the moment we are about to lose it.",
    "Truly fertile Music, the only kind that will move us, that we shall truly appreciate, will be a Music conducive to Dream, which banishes all reason and analysis. One must not wish first to understand and then to feel. Art does not tolerate Reason.",
    "A man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of a life are devoted to the earning of that money. Happiness is forgotten; the means are taken for the end.",
    "Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better.",
    "Those who prefer their principles over their happiness, they refuse to be happy outside the conditions they seem to have attached to their happiness.",
    "I was assailed by memories of a life that wasn't mine anymore, but one in which I'd found the simplest and most lasting joys.",
    "Without memories, without hope, they lived for the moment only. indeed, the here and now had come to mean everything to them. For there is no denying that the plague had gradually killed off in all of us the faculty not of love only but even of friendship. Naturally enough, since love asks something of the future, and nothing was left us but a series of present moments.",
    "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide.",
    "Too many have dispensed with generosity in order to practice charity.",
    "Instead of killing and dying in order to produce the being that we are not, we have to live and let live in order to create what we are.",
    "Only it takes time to be happy. A lot of time. Happiness, too, is a long patience.",
    "Freedom is not constituted primarily of privileges but of responsibilities.",
    "Every great work makes the human face more admirable and richer, and this is its whole secret.",
    "We always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love - first to their advantage, then to their disadvantage.",
    "To lose one's life is no great matter; when the time comes I'll have the courage to lose mine. But what's intolerable is to see one's life being drained of meaning, to be told there's no reason for existing. A man can't live without some reason for living.",
    "The urge to revolt is one of the essential dimensions of human nature.",
    "Where there is no hope, it is incumbent on us to invent it.",
    "Poverty, first of all was never a misfortune for me; it was radiant with sunlight.. I owe it to my family, first of all, who lacked everything and who envied practically nothing.",
    "True debauchery is liberating because it creates no obligations. In it you possess only yourself, hence it remains the favorite pastime of the great lovers of their own person.",
    "There can be no true goodness, nor true love, without the utmost clear-sightedness.",
    "With rebellion, awareness is born",
    "The absurd hero's refusal to hope becomes his singular ability to live in the present with passion.",
    "Great novelists are philosopher novelists - that is, the contrary of thesis-writers.",
    "A guilty conscience needs to confess. A work of art is a confession.",
    "There is no frontier between being and appearing.",
    "It is better to burn than to disappear.",
    "I cling like a miser to the freedom that disappears as soon as there is an excess of things.",
    "Violence is both unavoidable and unjustifiable.",
    "There are people who vindicate the world, who help others live just by their presence.",
    "The loss of love is the loss of all rights, even though one had them all.",
    "We're going forward, but nothing changes.",
    "Fancy language, like poplin, too often conceals an eczema.",
    "There are crimes of passion and crimes of logic. The boundary between them is not clearly defined.",
    "Happiness is generous. It does not subsist on destruction.",
    "Happiness implied a choice, and within that choice a concerted will, a lucid desire.",
    "But sometimes it takes more courage to live than to shoot yourself.",
    "Men and women consume one another rapidly in what is called \"the act of love,\" or else settle down to a mild habit of conjugality. We seldom find a mean between these two extremes.",
    "Any country where I am not bored is a country that teaches me nothing.",
    "There is merely bad luck in not being loved; there is misfortune in not loving. All of us, today, are dying of this misfortune. For violence and hatred dry up the heart itself; the long fight for justice exhausts the love that nevertheless gave birth to it.",
    "There is no more futile punishment than futile and hopeless labor.",
    "Men must live and create. Live to the point of tears.",
    "It is in the thick of calamity that one gets hardened to the truth - in other words, to silence.",
    "I felt as I hadn't felt for ages. I had a foolish desire to burst into tears. for the first time I'd realized how all these people loathed me.",
    "Truth and freedom, having few lovers, are demanding mistresses.",
    "In that daily effort in which intelligence and passion mingle and delight each other, the absurd man discovers a discipline that will make up the greatest of his strengths. The required diligence and doggedness and lucidity thus resemble the conqueror's attitude. To create is likewise to give a shape to one's fate. For all these characters, their work defines them at least as much as it is defined by them. The actor taught us this: There is no frontier between being and appearing.",
    "Liberty is dangerous, as hard to get along with as it is exciting.",
    "The Poor Man whom everyone speaks of, the Poor Man whom everyone pities, one of the repulsive Poor from whom charitable souls keep their distance, he has still said nothing. Or, rather, he has spoken through the voice of Victor Hugo, Zola, Richepin. At least, they said so. And these shameful impostures fed their authors. Cruel irony, the Poor Man tormented with hunger feeds those who plead his case.",
    "Healthy people have a natural skill of avoiding feverish eyes.",
    "I like people who dream or talk to themselves interminably; I like them, for they are double. They are here and elsewhere.",
    "The act of love . . . is a confession. Selfishness screams aloud, vanity shows off, or else true generosity reveals itself.",
    "It's not the struggle that makes us artists, but Art that makes us struggle.",
    "Camus himself described this work as 'an attempt to understand the time I live in'.",
    "To understand one's world, one must sometimes turn away from it! To serve better, one must briefly hold it at a distance. Where can the necessary solitude be found, the long breathing space in which mind gathers its strength and takes stock of its courage.",
    "By definition, a government has no conscience. Sometimes it has a policy, but nothing more.",
    "The act of love is a confession.",
    "... unhappiness is like marriage. We believe we chose it, but then it is choosing us. That is how it is, we can do nothing about it.",
    "No matter what cause one defends, it will suffer permanent disgrace if one resorts to blind attacks on crowds of innocent people.",
    "There is not one talent for living and another for creating. The same suffices for both. And one can be sure that the talent that could not produce but an artificial work could not sustain but a frivolous life.",
    "You make the mistake of thinking you have to choose, that you have to do what you want, that there are conditions for happiness. What matters — all that matters, really is the will to happiness, a kind of enormous, ever present consciousness. The rest - women , art, success — is nothing but excuses. A canvas waiting for our embroideries.",
    "The artist forges himself to the others, midway between the beauty he cannot do without and the community he cannot tear himself away from. That is why true artists scorn nothing: they are obliged to understand rather than to judge.",
    "Yes, and when the love of life disappears, no meaning can console us.",
    "Every time I hear a political speech or I read those of our leaders, I am horrified at having, for years, heard nothing which sounded human. It is always the same words telling the same lies.",
    "I grew up with the sea, and poverty for me was sumptuous; then I lost the sea and found all luxuries gray and poverty unbearable.",
    "The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.",
    "Purely historical thought is therefore nihilistic: it wholeheartedly accepts the evil of history and in this way is opposed to rebellion.",
    "To think is first of all to create a world (or to limit one's own world, which comes to the same thing).",
    "There are people who prefer to look their fate in the eye",
    "Truth, like light, blinds. Falsehood, on the contrary, is a beautiful twilight that enhances every object.",
    "Those who write clearly have readers.",
    "Against eternal injustice, man must assert justice, and to protest against the universe of grief, he must create happiness.",
    "...we rarely confide in those who are better than we. Rather, we are more inclined to flee their society. Most often, on the other hand, we confess to those who are like us and who share our weaknesses. Hence we don't want to improve ourselves and be bettered, for we should first have to be judged in default. We merely wish to be pitied and encouraged in the course we have chosen. In short, we should like, at the same time, to cease being guilty and yet not to make the effort of cleansing ourselves.",
    "For instance, I never complained that my birthday was overlooked; people were even surprised, with a touch of admiration, by my discretion on this subject. But the reason for my disinterestedness was even more discreet: I longed to be forgotten in order to be able to complain to myself... Once my solitude was thoroughly proved, I could surrender to the charms of a virile self-pity.",
    "Life can be magnificent and overwhelming -- that is the whole tragedy. Without beauty, love, or danger it would almost be easy to live.",
    "For there is merely bad luck in not being loved; there is misfortune in not loving.",
    "Life continues, and some mornings, weary of the noise, discouraged by the prospect of the interminable work to keep after, sickened also by the madness of the world that leaps at you from the newspaper, finally convinced that I will not be equal to it and that I will disappoint everyone - all I want to do is sit down and wait for evening. This is what I feel like, and sometimes I yield to it.",
    "We are all exceptional cases. We all want to appeal against something! Each of us insists on being innocent at all cost, even if he has to accuse the whole human race and heaven itself.",
    "A taste for truth at any cost is a passion which spares nothing.",
    "I love life - that’s my real weakness. I love it so much that I am incapable of imagining what is not life.",
    "In our well-policed society we recognize that an illness is serious from the fact that we don't dare speak of it directly.",
    "Artistic creation is a demand for unity and a rejection of the world.",
    "A work of art is a confession.",
    "To create today is to create dangerously. Any publication is an act, and that act exposes one to the passions of an age that forgives nothing.",
    "I know myself too well to believe in pure virtue.",
    "For what gives value to travel is fear. It breaks down a kind of inner structure we have. Travel robs us of such refuge. Far from our own people, our own language, stripped of all our props, deprived of our masks (one doesn't know the fare on the streetcars, or anything else), we are completely on the surface of ourselves.",
    "Men like us are good and proud and strong...if we had a faith, a God, nothing could undermine us. But we had nothing, we had to learn everything, and living for honor alone has its weaknesses.",
    "I do not believe in God and I am not an atheist.",
    "I spent a long time looking at faces, drinking in smiles. Am I happy or unhappy? It’s not a very important question. I live with such frenzied intensity. Things and people are waiting for me, and doubtless I am waiting for them and desiring them with all my strength and sadness. But, here, I earn the right to be alive by silence and by secrecy. The miracle of not having to talk about oneself.",
    "One must imagine Sisyphus happy.",
    "I draw from the Absurd three consequences: my revolt, my liberty, my passion.",
    "Today we are always as ready to judge as we are to fornicate.",
    "A nihilist is not one who believes in nothing , but one who does not believe in what exists.",
    "Why must one love rarely to love well?",
    "The only real progress lies in learning to be wrong all alone.",
    "The work of art is born of the intelligence's refusal to reason the concrete.  It marks the triumph of the carnal.",
    "Something must happen; that is the reason for most human relationships. Something must happen; even servitude in love, in war, ordeath.",
    "Youth is above all a collection of possibilities.",
    "What would become of the world if the condemned started to confide their heartaches to the executioners?",
    "The most knowledgeable person in one domain may be the most ignorant in another.",
    "There is a solitude in poverty, but a solitude which restores to each thing its value.",
    "Intelligence in chains loses in lucidity what it gains in intensity.",
    "A true masterpiece does not tell everything.",
    "For a man who loves power, competition from the gods is annoying. I have done away with that. I have proven to these illusory godsthat a man, if he has the will, can practice, without any apprenticeship, their ridiculous trade.",
    "In art, rebellion is consummated and perpetuated in the act of real creation, not in criticism or commentary.",
    "Truth is mysterious, elusive, always to be conquered. Liberty is dangerous, as hard to live with as it is elating. We must march toward these two goals, painfully but resolutely, certain in advance of our failings on so long a road.",
    "To remain a man in today's world, one must have not only unfailing energy and unwavering intensity, one must also have a little luck.",
    "History only exists, in the final analysis, for God.",
    "Old women even forget how to love their sons. The heart gets worn out, Monsieur.",
    "Great ideas, it has been said, come into the world as gently as doves. Perhaps then, if we listen attentively, we shall hear amid the uproar of empires and nations, a faint flutter of wings, the gentle stirring of life and hope. Some will say that this hope lies in a nation; others in a man. I believe rather that it is awakened, revived, nourished, by millions of solitary individuals whose and works every day negate frontiers and the crudest implications of history.",
    "To lose the touch of flowers and women's hands is the supreme separation.",
    "Freedom is not a gift received from the State or leader, but a possession to be won every day by the effort of each and the union of all.",
    "... one cannot be happy in exile or in oblivion. One cannot always be a stranger. I want to return to my homeland, make all my loved ones happy. I see no further than this.",
    "Of course, true love is exceptional - two or three times a century, more or less. The rest of the time there is vanity or boredom.",
    "A man's work is nothing but this slow trek to rediscover, through the detours of art, those two or three great and simple images in whose presence his heart first opened.",
    "We turn toward God only to obtain the impossible.",
    "In the vast reaches of the dry, cold night, thousands of stars were constantly appearing, and their sparkling icicles, loosened at once, began to slip gradually toward the horizon.",
    "As soon as one does not kill oneself, one must keep silent about life.",
    "In the end, we would like not to be guilty while at the same time being dispensed of the effort of purifying ourselves. Not enough cynicism and not enough virtue.",
    "No excuses ever, for anyone; that is my principle at the outset. I deny the good intention, the respectable mistake, the indiscretion, the extenuating circumstance. With me there is no giving of absolution or blessing.",
    "Wandering seemed no more than the happiness of an anxious man.",
    "The more I produce, the less I am certain. On the road along which the artist walks, night falls ever more densely. Finally, he dies blind.",
    "All that I know most surely about morality and obligations I owe to football.",
    "My chief occupation, despite appearances, has always been love.",
    "I'd buy myself a cabin on the beach, I'd put some glue in my navel, and I'd stick a flag in there. Then I'd wait to see which way the wind was blowing.",
    "We are not so mad as to think that we shall create a world in which murder will not occur. We are fighting for a world in which murder will no longer be legal.",
    "There is so much stubborn hope in the human heart.",
    "We spend our days in deliberating, and we end them without coming to any resolve.",
    "Heroism is accessible. Happiness is more difficult.",
    "A man without ethics is a wild beast loosed upon this world.",
    "Greatness consists in trying to be great. There is no other way.",
    "There is always a certain hour of the day and of the night when a man’s courage is at its lowest ebb, and it was that hour only that he feared.",
    "Ah, mon cher, for anyone who is alone, without God and without a master, the weight of days is dreadful.",
    "There's the risk of being loved...and that would keep me from being happy.",
    "The sense of doing good , the satisfaction of being right, the joy of looking favorably upon oneself, dear sir, are powerful levers for keeping us upright and making us progress. On the other hand, if men are deprived of that feeling, they are changed into rabid dogs.",
    "But what are a hundred million deaths? When one has served in a war, one hardly knows what a dead man is, after a while. And since a dead man has no substance unless one has actually seen him dead, a hundred million corpses broadcast through history are no more than a puff of smoke in the imagination.",
    "One dies if necessary, one breaks rather than bending. But I bend, because I continue to love myself.",
    "What can a meaning outside my condition mean to me? I can understand only in human terms. What I touch, what resists me - that I understand. And these two certainties - my appetite for the absolute and for unity and the impossibility of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle - I also know that I cannot reconcile them. What other truth can I admit without lying, without bringing in a hope I lack and which means nothing within the limits of my conditions?",
    "It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I'd been happy, and that I was happy still. For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration.",
    "Rule: Start by looking for what is valid in every man.",
    "The most loathsome materialism is not the kind people usually think of, but the sort that attempts to let dead ideas pass for living realities, diverting into sterile myths the stubborn and lucid attention we give to what we have within us that must forever die.",
    "The only really committed artist is he who, without refusing to take part in the combat, at least refuses to join the regular armies and remains a freelance.",
    "At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman.",
    "Although it was the middle of winter, I finally realized that, within me, summer was inextinguishable.",
    "The best revenge you can have on intellectuals is to be madly happy.",
    "My life was lucky so that I met, I loved (and disappointed) only outstanding people.",
    "We are living in the era of premeditation and the perfect crime. Our criminals are no longer helpless children who could plead love as their excuse. On the contrary, they are adults and the have the perfect alibi: philosophy, which can be used for any purpose - even for transforming murderers into judges.",
    "I am too much in love with my lies and hypocrisies not to confess them fervently.",
    "A profound thought is in a constant state of becoming; it adopts the experience of a life and assumes its shape.",
    "We [Raymond and Meursault] stared at each other without blinking, and everything came to a stop there between the sea, the sand, and the sun, and the double silence of the flute and the water. It was then that I realized that you could either shoot or not shoot.",
    "It is always easy to be logical. It is almost impossible to be logical to the bitter end.",
    "Culture: the cry of men in face of their destiny.",
    "It is impossible to give a clear account of the world, but art can teach us to reproduce it-just as the world reproduces itself in the course of its eternal gyrations. The primordial sea indefatigably repeats the same words and casts up the same astonished beings on the same sea-shore.",
    "But too many people now climb onto the cross merely to be seen from a greater distance, even if they have to trample somewhat on the one who has been there so long.",
    "The first choice an artist makes is precisely to be an artist, and if he chooses to be an artist it is in consideration of what he is himself and because of a certain idea he has of art",
    "All men have a sweetness in their life. That is what helps them go on. It is towards that they turn when they feel too worn out.",
    "I felt as though I was partly unlearning what i had never learned and yet knew so well: I mean, how to live.",
    "It is not your paintings I like, it is your painting.",
    "Indeed, men never know how to love. nothing satisfies them. All they know is to dream, to imagine new duties, to look for new countries and new homes. While we women, we know that we must hasten to love, to share the same bed, hold hands, and fear absence. When we women love, we dream of nothing.",
    "Turbulent childhood, adolescent daydreams in the drone of the bus's motor, mornings, unspoiled girls, beaches, young muscles always at the peak of their effort, evening's slight anxiety in a sixteen-year-old-heart, lust for life, fame, and ever the same sky through the years, unfailing in strength and light, itself insatiable, consuming one by one over a period of months the victims stretched out in the form of crosses on the beach at the deathlike hour of noon.",
    "I was tormented by my desire for a woman ... I thought so much about a woman, about women, about all the ones I had known, about all the circumstances in which I had enjoyed them, that my cell would be filled with their faces and crowded with my desires.",
    "One always has exaggerated ideas about what one doesn't know.",
    "Capital punishment is the most premeditated of murders, to which no criminal's deed, however calculated can be compared. For there to be an equivalency, the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date at which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who, from that moment onward, had confined him at his mercy for months. Such a monster is not encountered in private life.",
    "Without culture, and the relative freedom it implies, society, even when perfect, is but a jungle. This is why any authentic creation is a gift to the future.",
    "An intense feeling carries with it its own universe, magnificent or wretched as the case may be.",
    "We can't do without dominating others or being served.... The essential thing, in sum, is being able to get angry without the other person being able to answer back.",
    "There is no love of life without despair of life.",
    "From Pandora's Box, where all the ills of humanity swarmed, the Greeks drew out hope after all the others, as the most dreadful of all. I know no more stirring symbol; for, contrary to the general belief, hope equals resignation. And to live is not to resign oneself.",
    "To govern means to pillage, as everyone knows.",
    "Every authentic work of art is a gift offered to the future.",
    "All healthy men have thought of their own suicide",
    "The most elementary form of rebellion, paradoxically , expresses an aspiration for order .",
    "The absurd is the essential concept and the first truth.",
    "It was in Spain that [my generation] learned that one can be right and yet be beaten, that force can vanquish spirit, that there are times when courage is not its own recompense. It is this, doubtless, which explains why so many, the world over, feel the Spanish drama as a personal tragedy.",
    "I have a good, hearty laugh and an energetic handshake, and those are trump cards.",
    "I can negate everything of that part of me that lives on vague nostalgias, except this desire for unity, this longing to solve, this need for clarity and cohesion. I can refute everything in this world surrounding me that offends or enraptures me, except this chaos, this sovereign chance and this divine equivalence which springs from anarchy. I don't know whether this world has meaning that transcends it. But I know that I do not know that meaning and that it is impossible for me just now to know it. What can a meaning outside my condition mean to me? I can understand only in human terms.",
    "Human relationships always help us to carry on because they always presuppose further developments, a future - and also because we live as if our only task was precisely to have relationships with other people.",
    "Mon cher ami, let's not give them any pretext, no matter how small, for judging us!!! Otherwise, we'll be left in shreds. We are forced to take the same precautions as the animal trainer. If, before going into the cage, he has the misfortune to cut himself while shaving, what a feast for the wild animals!!",
    "He was conscious of the disastrous fact that love and desire must be expressed in the same way.",
    "Whatever prevents you from doing your work has become your work.",
    "I knew that I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I'd been happy. Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.",
    "A free press can, of course, be good or bad, but, most certainly without freedom, the press will never be anything but bad.",
    "There can be no question of masking the evidence, of suppressing the absurd by denying one of the terms of its equation. It is essential to know whether one can live with it or whether, on the other hand, logic commands one to die of it.",
    "Do not wait for the Last Judgment. It takes place every day.",
    "Truth is not a virtue, but a passion. It is never charitable.",
    "He had opened his heart to the sublime indifference of the universe",
    "There are plagues, and there are victims, and it's the duty of good men not to join forces with the plagues.",
    "If the descent is thus sometimes performed in sorrow, it can also take place in joy.",
    "When I see a new face, something sets off an alarm bell inside me. 'slow down! Danger!' Even when the attraction is strongest, I am on my guard.",
    "In order to understand the world, one has to turn away from it on occasion; in order to serve others better, one has to hold them at a distance for a time. But where can one find the solitude necessary to vigor, the deep breath in which the mind collects itself and courage gauges its strength? There remain big cities.",
    "In this respect, our townsfolk were like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves; in other words, they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences. A pestilence isn't a thing made to man's measure; therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind, a bad dream that will pass away. But it doesn't always pass away and, from one bad dream to another, it is men who pass away, and the humanists first of all, because they have taken no precautions.",
    "The look of success, when it is worn a certain way, would infuriate a jackass.",
    "...he said firmly, \"God can help you. All the men I’ve seen in your position turned to Him in their time of trouble.\" \"Obviously,\" I replied, \"they were at liberty to do so, if they felt like it.\" I, however, didn’t want to be helped, and I hadn’t time to work up interest for something that didn’t interest me.",
    "Note, besides, that it is no more immoral to directly rob citizens than to slip indirect taxes into the price of goods that they cannot do without.",
    "He knew now that it was his own will to happiness which must make the next move. But if he was to do so, he realized that he must come to terms with time, that to have time was at once the most magnificent and the most dangerous of experiments. Idleness is fatal only to the mediocre.",
    "I am not made for politics because I am incapable of wanting or accepting the death of the adversary.",
    "Nothing is given to mankind and what little men can conquer must be paid for with unjust death. But man's grandeur lies elsewhere, in his decision to rise above his condition.",
    "Thinking of the future, establishing aims for oneself, having preferences-all this presupposes a belief in freedom, even if one occasionally ascertains that one doesn't feel it.",
    "What is a rebel? A man who says no: but whose refusal does not imply a renunciation.",
    "Everybody knows that pestilences have a way of recurring in the world; yet somehow we find it hard to believe in ones that crash down on our heads from a blue sky.",
    "To create is likewise to give a shape to one's fate",
    "Yes, there was an element of abstraction and unreality in misfortune. But when an abstraction starts to kill you, you have to get to work on it.",
    "Old married people look so much alike that they have the same number of hairs in their ears.",
    "For the existentials, negation is their God. To be precise, that god is maintained only through the negation of human reason. But, like suicides, gods change with men.",
    "More and more, when faced with the world of men, the only reaction is one of individualism. Man alone is an end unto himself. Everything one tries to do for the common good ends in failure.",
    "The society of merchants can be defined as a society in which things disappear in favor of signs. When a ruling class measures its fortunes, not by the acre of land or the ingot of gold, but by the number of figures corresponding ideally to a certain number of exchange operations, it thereby condemns itself to setting a certain kind of humbug at the center of its experience and its universe. A society founded on signs is, in its essence, an artificial society in which man's carnal truth is handled as something artificial.",
    "What more ghastly image can be called up than that of a man betrayed by his body who, simply because he did not die in time, lives out the comedy while awaiting the end, face to face with that God he does not adore, serving him as he served life, kneeling before a void and arms outstretched toward a heaven without eloquence that he knows to be also without depth?",

    "Knowing what [Christ] knew , knowing all about mankind--ah! who would have thought that the crime is not so much to make others die, but to die oneself--confronted day and night with his innocent crime, it became too difficult to go on.

But, like methodical doubt, it can, by returning upon itself, open up a new field of investigation, and in the process of reasoning then pursues the same course. I proclaim that I believe in nothing and that everything is absurd, but I cannot doubt the validity of my proclamation and I must at least believe in my protest.",

In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm. I realized, through it all, that… In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.

Dreams change from individual, but the reality of the world is common to us all. Striving towards realism is therefore legitimate, for it is basically related to the artistic adventure.",

    "Truth, like light is dazzling. By contrast, untruth is a beautiful sunset that enhances everything.",
    "Thus I progressed on the surface of life, in the realm of words as it were, never in reality. All those books barely read, those friends barely loved, those cities barely visited, those women barely possessed! I went through the gestures out of boredom or absent-mindedness. Then came human beings; they wanted to cling, but there was nothing to cling to, and that was unfortunate--for them. As for me, I forgot. I never remembered anything but myself.",
    "And I too, felt ready to start life all over again. It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.",

    "Don't lies eventually lead to the truth? And don't all my stories, true or false, tend toward the same conclusion? Don't they all have the same meaning? So what does it matter whether they are true or false if, in both cases, they are significant of what I have been and what I am? Sometimes it is easier to see clearly into the liar than into the man who tells the truth. Truth, like light, blinds. Falsehood, on the contrary, is a beautiful twilight that enhances every object.",

    "Because there is nothing here than invites us to cherish unhappy lovers. Nothing is more vain than to die for love. What we ought to do is live.",
    "I would rather not have upset him, but I couldn't see any reason to change my life. Looking back on it, I wasn't unhappy. When I was a student, I had lots of ambitions like that. But when I had to give up my studies I learned very quickly that none of it really mattered.",

    "One of the only coherent philosophical positions is thus revolt. It is a constant confrontation between man and his own obscurity.",
    "Many fledgling moralists in those days were going about our town proclaiming there was nothing to be done about it and we should bow to the inevitable. And Tarrou, Rieux, and their friends might give one answer or another, but its conclusion was always the same, their certitude that a fight must be put up, in this way or that, and there must be no bowing down... There was nothing admirable about this attitude; it was merely logical.",
    "There may be responsible persons, but there are no guilty ones.",

    "What really counted was the possibility of escape, a leap to freedom, out of the implacable ritual, a wild run for it that would give whatever chance for hope there was. Of course, hope meant being cut down on some street corner, as you ran like mad, by a random bullet. But when I really thought it through, nothing was going to allow me such a luxury. Everything was against it; I would just be caught up in the machinery again.",

    "Paneloux is a man of learning, a scholar. He hasn't come in contact with death; that's why he can speak with such assurance of the truth-with a capital T. But every country priest who visits his parishioners and has heard a man gasping for breath on his deathbed thinks as I do. He'd try to relieve human suffering before trying to point out its goodness.",

    "There are always reasons for murdering a man. But there is no justification for his existence.",
    "But do you know why we are always more just and generous toward the dead? The reason is simple. With them there is no obligation. They leave us free and we can take our time, fit the testimonial between a cocktail party and a nice little mistress, in our spare time, in short.",

    "On the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn't the real point. But they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice or virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of an ignorance that fancies it knows everything and therefore claims for itself the right to kill. The soul of the murderer is blind; and there can be no true goodness nor true love without the utmost clear-sightedness.",

    "Thus, I always began by assuming the worst; my appeal was dismissed. That meant, of course, I was to die. Sooner than others, obviously. 'But,' I reminded myself, 'it's common knowledge that life isn't worth living, anyhow.' And, on a wide view, I could see that it makes little difference whether one dies at the age of thirty or threescore and ten-- since, in either case, other men will continue living, the world will go on as before. Also, whether I died now or forty years hence, this business of dying had to be got through, inevitably.",

    "The world I live in is loathsome to me, but I feel one with the men who suffer in it",
    "What, then, is that incalculable feeling that deprives the mind of the sleep necessary to life? A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity.",
    "The only conception of freedom I can have is that of the prisoner or the individual in the midst of the State. The only one I know is freedom of thought and action.",

    "All that remains is a fate whose outcome alone is fatal. Outside of that single fatality of death, everything, joy or happiness, is liberty. A world remains of which man is the sole master. What bound him was the illusion of another world. The outcome of his thought, ceasing to be renunciatory, flowers in images. It frolics-\\-\\-in myths, to be sure, but myths with no other depth than that of human suffering and, like it, inexhaustible. Not the divine fable that amuses and blinds, but the terrestrial face, gesture, and drama in which are summed up a difficult wisdom and an ephemeral passion.",
    "What made me run away was doubtless not so much the fear of settling down, but of settling down permanently in something ugly.",

    "The temptation shared by all forms of intelligence: cynicism.",
    "Time will prolong time, and life will serve life. In this field that is both limited and bulging with possibilities, everything to himself, except his lucidity, seems unforeseeable to him. What rule, then, could emanate from that unreasonable order? The only truth that might seem instructive to him is not formal: it comes to life and unfolds in men. The absurd mind cannot so much expect ethical rules at the end of its reasoning as, rather, illustrations and the breath of human lives.",
    "The current motto for all of us can only be this: without giving up anything on the plane of justice, yield nothing on the plane of freedom.",
    "When the throne of God is overturned, the rebel realizes that it is now his own responsibility to create the justice, order, and unity that he sought in vain within his own condition, and in this way to justify the fall of God. Then begins the desperate effort to create, at the price of crime and murder if necessary, the dominion of man.",
    "There can be no question of holding forth on ethics. I have seen people behave badly with great morality and I note every day that integrity has no need of rules",
    "What's natural is the microbe. All the rest-heath, integrity, purity (if you like)-is a product of the human will, of a vigilance that must never falter. The good man, the man who infects hardly anyone, is the man who has the fewest lapses of attention.",

    "Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined. Society has but little connection with such beginnings. The worm is in man's heart. That is where it must be sought. One must follow and understand this fatal game that leads from lucidity in the face of existence to flight from light.",
    "The rebel can never find peace. He knows what is good and, despite himself, does evil. The value which supports him is never given to him once and for all - he must fight to uphold it, unceasingly.",
    "The first progressive step for a mind overwhelmed by the strangeness of things is to realize that this feeling of strangeness is shared with all men and that human reality, in its entirety, suffers from the distance which separates it from the rest of the universe.",
    "We must stitch up what has been torn apart, render justice imaginable in the world which is so obviously unjust, make happiness meaningful for nations poisoned by the misery of this century. Naturally, it is a superhuman task. But tasks are called superhuman when men take a long time to complete them, that is all.",
    "Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable. It would be a mistake to say that happiness necessarily springs from the absurd discovery. It happens as well that the felling of the absurd springs from happiness. \"I conclude that all is well,\" says Oedipus, and that remark is sacred. It echoes in the wild and limited universe of man.

    "...the habit of despair is worse than despair itself.",
    "I said that the world is absurd, but I was too hasty. This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart.",
    "Morality, when formal, devours.",

    "There always comes a time when one must choose between contemplation and action. This is called becoming a man.",
    "An intellectual? Yes. And never deny it. An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself. I like this, because I am happy to be both halves, the watcher and the watched. \"Can they be brought together?\" This is a practical question. We must get down to it. \"I despise intelligence\" really means: \"I cannot bear my doubts.",

    "When I look at my life and its secret colors, I feel like bursting into tears.",
    "In order to speak about all and to all, one has to speak of what all know and of the reality common to us all. The sea, rains, necessity, desire, the struggle against death... these are things that unite us all.",

So what's the good of dying intentionally, of sacrificing yourself to the idea you want people to have of you?

    "The love of God is a hard love. It demands total self-surrender, disdain of our human personality. And yet it alone can reconcile us to suffering and the deaths of children, it alone can justify them, since we cannot understand them, and we can only make God's will ours.",
